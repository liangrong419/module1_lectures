Single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large\\r\\nfortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our\\r\\ngirls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?  How can it affect them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so\\r\\n tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Design!  Nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely\\r\\nthat he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\nmust visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you\\r\\nmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\\r\\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley\\r\\nmay like you the best of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly HAVE had my share of\\r\\nbeauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give\\r\\nover thinking of her own beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think\\r\\nof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when\\r\\nhe comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an\\r\\nestablishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William and\\r\\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for\\r\\nin general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you\\r\\nmust go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will\\r\\nbe very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\nassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\nchooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for\\r\\n my little Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\ngiving HER the preference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied\\r\\nhe; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\nsomething more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a\\r\\nway?  You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion\\r\\nfor my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your\\r\\nnerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention\\r\\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic\\r\\nhumour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-\\r\\ntwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand\\r\\nhis character.  HER mind was less difficult to develop.  She was\\r\\na woman of mean understanding, little information, and\\r\\nuncertain temper.  When she was discontented, she fancied\\r\\nherself nervous.  The business of her life was to get her\\r\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\nalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\nevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.  It\\r\\nwas then disclosed in the following manner: --Observing his\\r\\nsecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\\r\\naddressed her with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,\" said\\r\\nher mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet\\r\\nhim at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two\\r\\nnieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\nhave no opinion of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that\\r\\nyou do not depend on her serving you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\\r\\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake!  Have a little\\r\\ncompassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she\\r\\ntimes them ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\r\\nintroduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is\\r\\ncertainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\nthe end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else\\r\\nwill; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their\\r\\nchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if\\r\\nyou decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress\\r\\nthat is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\nTHERE. What say you, Mary?  For you are a young lady of\\r\\ndeep reflection, I know, and read great books and make\\r\\nextracts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that\\r\\nbefore?  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would\\r\\nnot have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\npaid the visit; we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\r\\ntumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\nhad expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I\\r\\nshould\\r\\npersuade you at last.  I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\nneglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\nsuch a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning\\r\\nand never said a word about it till now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr.\\r\\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\nraptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the\\r\\ndoor was shut.  \"I do not know how you will ever make him\\r\\namends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.  At our\\r\\ntime of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\nacquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\nanything.  Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare\\r\\nsay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I AM the\\r\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\nwould return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they\\r\\nshould ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\nfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\nfrom her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\nThey attacked him in various way-- with barefaced questions,\\r\\ningenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\nskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\nsecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.  Her\\r\\nreport was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted\\r\\nwith him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome,\\r\\nextremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be\\r\\nat the next assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more\\r\\ndelightful!  To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards\\r\\nfalling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart\\r\\nwere entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\\r\\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat\\r\\nabout ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained\\r\\nhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of\\r\\nwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\\r\\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the\\r\\nadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore\\r\\na blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\nalready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\ncredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\\r\\ndeferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the\\r\\nfollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour\\r\\nof their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\\r\\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\\r\\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\\r\\nthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,\\r\\nand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas\\r\\nquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone\\r\\nto London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\\r\\nsoon followed, that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\r\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved\\r\\nover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day\\r\\nbefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought\\r\\nonly six with him from London-- his five sisters and a cousin.\\r\\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of\\r\\nonly five altogether-- Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\\r\\nof the eldest, and another young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a\\r\\npleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His\\r\\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.  His\\r\\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but\\r\\nhis friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by\\r\\nhis fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\\r\\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\\r\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The\\r\\ngentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\\r\\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and\\r\\nhe was looked at with great admiration for about half the\\r\\nevening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of\\r\\nhis popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above\\r\\nhis company, and above being pleased; and not all his large\\r\\nestate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to\\r\\nbe compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\ndanced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,\\r\\nand talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable\\r\\nqualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between\\r\\nhim and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\\r\\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced\\r\\nto any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\\r\\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\r\\nHis character was decided.  He was the proudest, most\\r\\ndisagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he\\r\\nwould never come there again.  Amongst the most violent\\r\\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\\r\\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\r\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of\\r\\ngentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\\r\\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\\r\\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\\r\\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.  I hate to see\\r\\nyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had\\r\\nmuch better dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as\\r\\nthis it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\nthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\npunishment to me to stand up with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley,\\r\\n\"for a kingdom!  Upon my honour, I never met with so many\\r\\npleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are\\r\\nseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But\\r\\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is\\r\\nvery pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\\r\\npartner to introduce you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\\r\\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own\\r\\nand coldly said:  \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to\\r\\ntempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence\\r\\nto young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better\\r\\nreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting\\r\\nyour time with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\nElizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\\r\\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her\\r\\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted\\r\\nin anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole\\r\\nfamily.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\\r\\nadmired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with\\r\\nher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane\\r\\nwas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in\\r\\na quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure.  Mary had heard\\r\\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished\\r\\ngirl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\r\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all\\r\\nthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned,\\r\\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they\\r\\nlived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They\\r\\nfound Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book he was regardless of\\r\\ntime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of\\r\\ncuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such\\r\\nsplendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that his wife\\'s\\r\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\\r\\nfound out that he had a different story to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have\\r\\nhad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you\\r\\nhad been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought\\r\\nher quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!  Only think of\\r\\nTHAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was\\r\\nthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\\r\\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him\\r\\nstand up with her!  But, however, he did not admire her at all;\\r\\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with\\r\\nJane as she was going down the dance.  So he inquired who she\\r\\nwas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then\\r\\nthe two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\\r\\n Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\\r\\nsixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he had had any compassion for ME,\" cried her husband\\r\\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much!  For God\\'s\\r\\nsake, say no more of his partners.  O that he had\\r\\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him.  He is so\\r\\nexcessively handsome!  And his sisters are charming women.  I\\r\\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.  I\\r\\ndare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against\\r\\nany description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek\\r\\nanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness\\r\\nof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose\\r\\nmuch by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,\\r\\nhorrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited\\r\\nthat there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he\\r\\nwalked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome\\r\\nenough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to\\r\\nhave given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\nsister just how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\r\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--\\r\\nso much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man\\r\\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby\\r\\ncomplete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\ntime.  I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you? I did for you.  But that is one great difference\\r\\nbetween us.  Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and\\r\\nME never.  What could be more natural than his asking you\\r\\nagain?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times\\r\\nas pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his\\r\\ngallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\\r\\ngive you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider\\r\\nperson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\ngeneral.  You never see a fault in anybody.  All the world are\\r\\ngood and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of\\r\\na human being in your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\r\\nspeak what I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder.  With\\r\\nYOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\nnonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common enough--\\r\\none meets with it everywhere.  But to be candid without\\r\\nostentation or design-- to take the good of everybody\\'s\\r\\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--\\r\\nbelongs to you alone.  And so you like this man\\'s sisters, too, do\\r\\nyou?  Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not-- at first.  But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\nyou converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her\\r\\nbrother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall\\r\\nnot find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\ngeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\nof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\r\\nany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\nthem.  They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\nhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\r\\nthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\r\\nconceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in\\r\\none of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of\\r\\ntwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more\\r\\nthan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and\\r\\nwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\r\\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable\\r\\nfamily in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\r\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune\\r\\nand their own had been acquired by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\\r\\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to\\r\\npurchase an estate, but did not live to do it.  Mr. Bingley\\r\\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;\\r\\nbut as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of\\r\\na manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\\r\\neasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\r\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next\\r\\ngeneration to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\r\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\nwas by no means unwilling to preside at his table-- nor was Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\ndisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\nMr. Bingley had not been or age two years, when he was tempted\\r\\nby an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\\r\\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour-- was pleased with\\r\\nthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\\r\\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\nspite of great opposition of character.  Bingley was endeared to\\r\\nDarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\nthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\nand though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the\\r\\nstrength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\nof his judgement the highest opinion.  In understanding, Darcy\\r\\nwas the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy\\r\\nwas clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\nfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\r\\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was\\r\\nsure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\ngiving offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\nsufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with more\\r\\npleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\nmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\nstiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\r\\nto Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention\\r\\nor pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she\\r\\nsmiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so-- but still they\\r\\nadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet\\r\\ngirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\\r\\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their\\r\\nbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as\\r\\nhe chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom\\r\\nthe Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had\\r\\nbeen formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a\\r\\ntolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an\\r\\naddress to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had\\r\\nperhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to\\r\\nhis business, and to his residence in a small market town; and,\\r\\nin quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a\\r\\nhouse about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\\r\\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his\\r\\nown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself\\r\\nsolely in being civil to all the world.  For, though elated by his\\r\\nrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was\\r\\nall attention to everybody.  By nature inoffensive, friendly, and\\r\\nobliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him\\r\\ncourteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to\\r\\nbe a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.  They had several\\r\\nchildren.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young\\r\\nwoman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to\\r\\ntalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after\\r\\nthe assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\ncommunicate. \"YOU began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.  \"YOU\\r\\nwere Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her\\r\\ntwice. To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her-- indeed I\\r\\nrather believe he DID-- I heard something about it-- but I\\r\\nhardly know what-- something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\\r\\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson\\'s asking\\r\\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\\r\\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\\r\\nand WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering\\r\\nimmediately to the last question:  \\'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\r\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word!  Well, that is very decided indeed-- that does\\r\\nseem as if-- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS,\\r\\nEliza,\" said Charlotte.  \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth\\r\\nlistening to as his friend, is he?-- poor Eliza!-- to be only just\\r\\nTOLERABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by\\r\\nhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\\r\\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long\\r\\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\\r\\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?-- is not there a little mistake?\"\\r\\nsaid Jane.  \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,\\r\\nand he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed\\r\\nquite angry at being spoke to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\r\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances.  With THEM he is\\r\\nremarkably agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very\\r\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess\\r\\nhow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I\\r\\ndare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep\\r\\na carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n\"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\\r\\nwith HIM, if I were you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend ME so much as\\r\\npride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot\\r\\nwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\neverything in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I\\r\\nmay so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\\r\\nforgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity\\r\\nof her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\nthat I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\nindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\nthere are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\nself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\nimaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\nwords are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud\\r\\nwithout being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of\\r\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\\r\\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was.  I\\r\\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\nyour bottle directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\nthat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.\\r\\nThe visit was soon returned in due form.  Miss Bennet\\'s\\r\\npleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\r\\nBingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable,\\r\\nand the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of\\r\\nbeing better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards\\r\\nthe two eldest.  By Jane, this attention was received with the\\r\\ngreatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in\\r\\ntheir treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,\\r\\nand could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it\\r\\nwas, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence\\r\\nof their brother\\'s admiration.  It was generally evident\\r\\nwhenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was\\r\\nequally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which\\r\\nshe had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\r\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure\\r\\nthat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,\\r\\nsince Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure\\r\\nof temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would\\r\\nguard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She\\r\\nmentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to\\r\\nimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her\\r\\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\nthe opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark.  There is\\r\\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that\\r\\nit is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can all BEGIN freely-- a\\r\\nslight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\nwho have heart enough to be really in love without\\r\\nencouragement.  In nine cases out of ten a women had better\\r\\nshow MORE affection than she feels.  Bingley, likes your\\r\\nsister, undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if\\r\\nshe does not help him on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.  If\\r\\nI can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\r\\nindeed, not to discover it too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as\\r\\nyou do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\nconceal it, he must find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But, though\\r\\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many\\r\\nhours together; and, as they always see each other in large\\r\\nmixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\\r\\nemployed in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make\\r\\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\r\\nattention.  When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure\\r\\nfor falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is\\r\\nin question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\r\\ndetermined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\nshould adopt it.  But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not\\r\\nacting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.  She has\\r\\nknown him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him\\r\\nat Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\\r\\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\\r\\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she\\r\\nmight only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\nyou must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\r\\ntogether-- and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\nthey both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect\\r\\nto any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much\\r\\nhas been unfolded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\nand if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she\\r\\nhad as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying\\r\\nhis character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is\\r\\nentirely  a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the parties are\\r\\never so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand,\\r\\nit does not advance their felicity in the least.  They always\\r\\ncontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their\\r\\nshare of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of\\r\\nthe defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know\\r\\nit is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister,\\r\\nElizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\nan object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\nher without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\nlooked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner had he made it\\r\\nclear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature\\r\\nin her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly\\r\\nintelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.  To this\\r\\ndiscovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.  Though he\\r\\nhad detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect\\r\\nsymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure\\r\\nto be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her\\r\\nmanners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught\\r\\nby their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to\\r\\nher he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere,\\r\\nand who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\nconversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\nothers.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William\\r\\nLucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\\r\\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\nsee what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not\\r\\nbegin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\\r\\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\\r\\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately\\r\\nprovoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\\r\\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster\\r\\nto give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\r\\nenergetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.  \"I\\r\\nam going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\\r\\nfollows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!-- always\\r\\nwanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!  If\\r\\nmy vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been\\r\\ninvaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before\\r\\nthose who must be in the habit of hearing the very best\\r\\nperformers.\"  On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added,\\r\\n\"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\"  And gravely glancing at Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\r\\ncourse familiar with:  \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\';\\r\\nand I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\\r\\nAfter a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties\\r\\nof several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded\\r\\nat the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence\\r\\nof being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for\\r\\nknowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for\\r\\ndisplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\nher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\nconceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\nexcellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\nhad been listened to with much more pleasure, though not\\r\\nplaying half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto,\\r\\nwas glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish\\r\\nairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the\\r\\nLucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at\\r\\none end of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode\\r\\nof passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\nwas too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\nWilliam Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as\\r\\none of the first refinements of polished society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\namongst the less polished societies of the world.  Every savage\\r\\ncan dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William only smiled.  \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\r\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I\\r\\ndoubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\nsight.  Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\\r\\nplace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-- for I am\\r\\nfond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the\\r\\nair of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\ndisposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\ntowards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very\\r\\ngallant thing, and called out to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?  Mr. Darcy, you\\r\\nmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a very\\r\\ndesirable partner.  You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when\\r\\nso much beauty is before you.\"  And, taking her hand, he would\\r\\nhave given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised,\\r\\nwas not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,\\r\\nand said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.  I entreat\\r\\nyou not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a\\r\\npartner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\nhonour of her hand, but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\ndid Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\npersuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\ndeny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\ndislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I\\r\\nam sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\nEliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance-- for who would\\r\\nobject to such a partner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had\\r\\nnot injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her\\r\\nwith some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass\\r\\nmany evenings in this manner-- in such society; and indeed I am\\r\\nquite of you opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The insipidity,\\r\\nand yet the noise-- the nothingness, and yet the self-importance\\r\\nof all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on\\r\\nthem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was\\r\\nmore agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very\\r\\ngreat pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty\\r\\nwoman can bestow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, a desired he\\r\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\nreflections.  Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley.  \"I am all\\r\\nastonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite?-- and\\r\\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.  A\\r\\nlady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\nlove, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would\\r\\nbe wishing me joy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\r\\nabsolutely settled.  You will be having a charming\\r\\nmother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at\\r\\nPemberley with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\r\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\nher that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\ntwo thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\nentailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their\\r\\nmother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could\\r\\nbut ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an\\r\\nattorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\nto their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\nsettled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a\\r\\nmost convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\ntempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\ntheir aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way.  The two\\r\\nyoungest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\nfrequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\ntheir sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\nMeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and\\r\\nfurnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\r\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\r\\nsome from their aunt.  At present, indeed, they were well\\r\\nsupplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of\\r\\na militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the\\r\\nwhole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\r\\ninteresting intelligence.  Every day added something to their\\r\\nknowledge of the officers\\' names and connections.  Their\\r\\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to\\r\\nknow the officers themselves.  Mr. Phillips visited them all, and\\r\\nthis opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\\r\\nThey could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large\\r\\nfortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother,\\r\\nwas worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\r\\nan ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\r\\nBennet coolly observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\nbe two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have suspected it\\r\\nsome time, but I am now convinced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia,\\r\\nwith perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\nCaptain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\nday, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should\\r\\nbe so ready to think your own children silly.  If I wished to think\\r\\nslightingly of anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\nhowever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\nagree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\nparticular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have\\r\\nthe sense of their father and mother.  When they get to our age, I\\r\\ndare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\nI remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--\\r\\nand, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young\\r\\ncolonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my\\r\\ngirls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster\\r\\nlooked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his\\r\\nregimentals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\nCaptain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did\\r\\nwhen they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\nClarke\\'s library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\\r\\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,\\r\\nand the servant waited for an answer.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while\\r\\nher daughter read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from?  What is it about?  What does he\\r\\nsay?  Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\r\\n     \"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with\\r\\nLouisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for\\r\\nthe rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two\\r\\nwomen can never end without a quarrel.  Come as soon as you\\r\\ncan on receipt of this.  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine\\r\\nwith the officers.-- Yours ever,\\r\\n                                             \"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia.  \"I wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\nus of THAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\nlikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were\\r\\nsure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to\\r\\nMeryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\nThey are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s\\r\\npurpose will be answered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that\\r\\nthe horses were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\nhorseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\ncheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered;\\r\\nJane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters\\r\\nwere uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain\\r\\ncontinued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly\\r\\ncould not some back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more\\r\\nthan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.  Till\\r\\nthe next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity\\r\\nof her contrivance.  Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant\\r\\nfrom Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\r\\n     \"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I\\r\\nsuppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\\r\\nMy kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\\r\\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones-- therefore do not be\\r\\nalarmed if you should hear of his having been to me-- and,\\r\\nexcepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\r\\nmatter with me.-- Yours, etc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\nnote aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\nillness-- if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\nwas all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying.  People do not die of little\\r\\ntrifling colds.  She will be taken good care of.  As long as she\\r\\nstays there, it is all very well.  I would go an see her if I could\\r\\nhave the carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\nthough the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative.  She declared her\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such\\r\\na thing, in all this dirt!  You will not be fit to be seen when you\\r\\nget there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane-- which is all I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\nnothing when one has a motive; only three miles.  I shall be back\\r\\nby dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but\\r\\nevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\nopinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\nrequired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\\r\\nLydia.  Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\nladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps\\r\\nwe may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the\\r\\nlodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued\\r\\nher walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping\\r\\nover stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity,\\r\\nand finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\nankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\nexercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane\\r\\nwere assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal\\r\\nof surprise.  That she should have walked three miles so early in\\r\\nthe day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost\\r\\nincredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nconvinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was\\r\\nreceived, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s\\r\\nmanners there was something better than politeness; there was\\r\\ngood humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\r\\nHurst nothing at all.  The former was divided between\\r\\nadmiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her\\r\\ncomplexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming\\r\\nso far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\nMiss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\nnot well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was glad to be\\r\\ntaken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld\\r\\nby the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in\\r\\nher note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at\\r\\nher entrance.  She was not equal, however, to much\\r\\nconversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could\\r\\nattempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\r\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth silently\\r\\nattended her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\nElizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\naffection and solicitude they showed for Jane.  The apothecary\\r\\ncame, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\nsupposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\nendeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\nand promised her some draughts.  The advice was followed\\r\\nreadily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached\\r\\nacutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\r\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had,\\r\\nin fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\nvery unwillingly said so.  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\nand she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\ntestified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\nobliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\nremain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\nconsented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to\\r\\nacquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\nsix Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil inquiries\\r\\nwhich then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure\\r\\nof distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nshe could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no\\r\\nmeans better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\ntimes how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have\\r\\na bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill\\r\\nthemselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\r\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them\\r\\nrestored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\ncould regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\nevident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\nprevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\\r\\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little\\r\\nnotice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom\\r\\nElizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat,\\r\\ndrink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a\\r\\nplain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\nBingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\\r\\nHer manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture\\r\\nof pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no\\r\\nbeauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\nexcellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\nmorning.  She really looked almost wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\nVery nonsensical to come at all!  Why must SHE be scampering\\r\\nabout the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair, so\\r\\nuntidy, so blowsy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\ndeep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had\\r\\nbeen let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but\\r\\nthis was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\r\\nlooked remarkably well when she came into the room this\\r\\nmorning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n\"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see\\r\\nYOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it\\r\\nis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  What could\\r\\nshe mean by it?  It seems to me to show an abominable sort of\\r\\nconceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\ndecorum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\r\\nBingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\\r\\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\\r\\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"\\r\\nA short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\nvery sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\nsettled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\\r\\nMeryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\\r\\nCheapside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\nheartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\\r\\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\nof any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\ntheir hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the\\r\\nexpense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her\\r\\nroom on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\\r\\nsummoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had\\r\\nthe comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather\\r\\nright than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.  On\\r\\nentering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and\\r\\nwas immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\nplaying high, she declined it, for the short time she could stay\\r\\nbelow, with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\\r\\nsingular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a\\r\\ngreat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\"said\\r\\nBingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards\\r\\nthe table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered\\r\\nto fetch her others-- all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my\\r\\nown credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many,\\r\\nI have more than I ever looked into.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\nthose in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should\\r\\nhave left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\nyou have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\r\\ngenerations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\\r\\nalways buying books.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\nas these.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\nbeauties of that noble place.  Charles, when you build YOUR\\r\\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.  There\\r\\nis not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\\r\\nvery little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside,\\r\\nshe drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.\\r\\nBingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s\\r\\nheight, or rather taller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\ndelighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners!  And\\r\\nso extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the\\r\\npianoforte is exquisite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have\\r\\npatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\nmean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\nand net purses.  I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,\\r\\nand I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\ntime, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a\\r\\nwoman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or\\r\\ncovering a screen.  But I am very far from agreeing with you in\\r\\nyour estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing\\r\\nmore than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance,\\r\\nthat are really accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal\\r\\nin your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\r\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\nusually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\nmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\ndeserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain\\r\\nsomething in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her\\r\\nvoice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\nhalf-deserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she\\r\\nmust yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\nher mind by extensive reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\\r\\naccomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing\\r\\nANY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\\r\\npossibility of all this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw such a woman.  I never saw such capacity, and\\r\\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\nof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\nmany women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst\\r\\ncalled them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention\\r\\nto what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at\\r\\nan end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was\\r\\nclosed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to\\r\\nrecommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\\r\\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my\\r\\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\naddressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies\\r\\nsometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever\\r\\nbears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\ncontinue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\nworse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr.\\r\\nJones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced\\r\\nthat no country advice could be of any service, recommended an\\r\\nexpress to town for one of the most eminent physicians.  This\\r\\nshe would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply\\r\\nwith their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones\\r\\nshould be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not\\r\\ndecidedly better.  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\r\\ndeclared that they were miserable:  They solaced their\\r\\nwretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could\\r\\nfind no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper\\r\\ndirections that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and\\r\\nher sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and\\r\\nin the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\nanswer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\nBingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\nelegant ladies who waited on his sisters.  In spite of this\\r\\namendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\nLongbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\njudgement of her situation.  The note was immediately\\r\\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached\\r\\nNetherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would\\r\\nhave been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that\\r\\nher illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\nimmediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\nher from Netherfield.  She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\ndaughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\napothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\nadvisable.  After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\ndaughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met\\r\\nthem with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\nworse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill\\r\\nto be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\nWe must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley.  \"It must not be thought of.  My\\r\\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon it, madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\ncivility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention\\r\\nwhile she remains with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\nnot know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\nand suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\nworld, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\nexception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.  I often tell\\r\\nmy other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room\\r\\nhere, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel\\r\\nwalk.  I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\nNetherfield.  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope,\\r\\nthough you have but a short lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\r\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\nfive minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\nfixed here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\\r\\ntowards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- I understand you perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\nseen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is as it happens.  It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not\\r\\nrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that\\r\\nyour were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing study.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing.  They\\r\\nhave at least that advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few\\r\\nsubjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you move\\r\\nin a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something\\r\\nnew to be observed in them for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\nmentioning a country neighbourhood.  \"I assure you there is\\r\\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\nmoment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she\\r\\nhad gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places.  The\\r\\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\r\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same.  They have\\r\\neach their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- that is because you have the right disposition.  But that\\r\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was\\r\\nnothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\nher mother.  \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that\\r\\nthere was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\ncountry as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\nare few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with\\r\\nfour-and-twenty families.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\nhis countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\neyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nfor the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s\\r\\nthoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at\\r\\nLongbourn since HER coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable\\r\\nman Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?  So much the man of\\r\\nfashion!  So genteel and easy!  He had always something to say\\r\\nto everybody.  THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those\\r\\npersons who fancy themselves very important, and never open\\r\\ntheir mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about\\r\\nmince-pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\\r\\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very\\r\\ndifferently.  But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\nLucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a pity\\r\\nthey are not handsome!  Not that I think Charlotte so VERY\\r\\nplain-- but then she is our particular friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nherself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty.  I do not\\r\\nlike to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-- one does\\r\\nnot often see anybody better looking.  It is what everybody says.\\r\\nI do not trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen,\\r\\nthere was a man at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town so much in\\r\\nlove with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her\\r\\nan offer before we came away.  But, however, he did not.\\r\\nPerhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some\\r\\nverses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There\\r\\nhas been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.  I\\r\\nwonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving\\r\\naway love!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,\" said\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of  a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Everything nourishes\\r\\nwhat is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\nentirely away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\nElizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\nagain.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\nand after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\ntroubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly\\r\\ncivil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\nand say what the occasion required.  She performed her part\\r\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\nsatisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.  Upon this\\r\\nsignal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.  The\\r\\ntwo girls had been whispering to each other during the whole\\r\\nvisit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.\\r\\nBingley with having promised on his first coming into the\\r\\ncountry to give a ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with\\r\\nher mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an\\r\\nearly age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\nself-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom\\r\\nher uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\nher, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,\\r\\ntherefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\r\\nabruptly reminded him that it would be the most shameful thing\\r\\nin the world if he did not keep it.  His answer to this sudden\\r\\nattack was delightful to her mother\\'s ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\nwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\nvery day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be dancing\\r\\nwhen she is ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia declared herself satisfied.  \"Oh! yes-- it would be much\\r\\nbetter to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\nCaptain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you have\\r\\ngiven YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one\\r\\nalso.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\ndoes not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughter then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\nreturned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\'\\r\\nbehaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\nlatter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\ntheir censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on\\r\\nFINE EYES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\ninvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\nevening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.  The\\r\\nloo-table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\nMiss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\nletter and repeatedly calling his attention by messages to his\\r\\nsister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently\\r\\namused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\\r\\ncompanion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on\\r\\nhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length\\r\\nof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises\\r\\nwere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in\\r\\nunion with her opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\\r\\ncourse of a year!  Letters of business, too!  How odious I should\\r\\nthink them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.  I\\r\\nmend pens remarkably well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you-- but I always mend my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\nthe harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\nher beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely\\r\\nsuperior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\\r\\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  It is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.  But do\\r\\nyou always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not\\r\\nfor me to determine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\nwith ease, cannot write ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried\\r\\nher brother, \"because he does not write with ease.  He studies\\r\\ntoo much for words of four syllables.  Do not you, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless\\r\\nway imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--\\r\\nby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to\\r\\nmy correspondents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm\\r\\nreproof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\r\\nhumility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\nan indirect boast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of\\r\\nmodesty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a\\r\\nrapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\nestimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of\\r\\ndoing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\\r\\npossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\nthe performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that\\r\\nif you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be\\r\\ngone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\ncompliment to yourself-- and yet what is there so very laudable\\r\\nin a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\r\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\\r\\nelse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.  And, yet, upon\\r\\nmy honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\nbelieve it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\nthe character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\nthe ladies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\nyou would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be\\r\\nquite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if,\\r\\nas you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,  \\'Bingley,\\r\\nyou had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it,\\r\\nyou would probably not go-- and at another word, might stay a\\r\\nmonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\\r\\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have\\r\\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting\\r\\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\ntemper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\ngentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\nbetter of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\ndenial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\nintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\\r\\nspeak for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to\\r\\ncall mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the\\r\\ncase, however, to stand according to your representation, you\\r\\nmust remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to\\r\\ndesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has\\r\\nmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in\\r\\nfavour of its propriety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield readily-- easily-- to the PERSUASION of a friend is\\r\\nno merit with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\nunderstanding of either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\\r\\ninfluence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester\\r\\nwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting\\r\\nfor arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly\\r\\nspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance\\r\\noccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\r\\nthereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\\r\\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a\\r\\nresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that\\r\\nperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to be\\r\\nargued into it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance\\r\\nwhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\nintimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\r\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have\\r\\nmore weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\naware of.  I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\nfellow, in comparison with myself, that I should not pay him half\\r\\nso much deference.  I declare I do not know a more awful object\\r\\nthan Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at\\r\\nhis own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\nhe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss\\r\\nBingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\nexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.  \"You dislike an\\r\\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you\\r\\nand Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\nbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\nElizabeth for an indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved\\r\\nwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request\\r\\nthat Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely\\r\\nand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\\r\\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how\\r\\nfrequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew\\r\\nhow to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so\\r\\ngreat a man; and yet that he should look at her because he\\r\\ndisliked her, was still more strange.  She could only imagine,\\r\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was\\r\\nsomething more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas\\r\\nof right, than in any other person present.  The supposition did\\r\\nnot pain her.  She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\nnear Elizabeth, said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\nan opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with\\r\\nsome surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\r\\ndetermine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\nbut I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\ncheating a person of their meditated contempt.  I have,\\r\\ntherefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\ndance a reel at all-- and now despise me if you dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\nhis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\nin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\nand Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he\\r\\nwas by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority\\r\\nof her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\ngreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\nsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\ntalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\nsuch an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\nhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\nof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the\\r\\nyounger girls of running after officers.  And, if I may mention so\\r\\ndelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\nbordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\npossesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips get\\r\\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your\\r\\ngreat-uncle the judge.  They are in the same profession, you\\r\\nknow, only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you\\r\\nmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\\r\\nbeautiful eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\r\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might\\r\\nbe copied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley,\\r\\nin some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You used us abominably ill, \"answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running\\r\\naway without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\nto walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.  Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\ntheir rudeness, and immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go\\r\\ninto the avenue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\nthem, laughingly answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.  You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\nappear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be\\r\\nspoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the\\r\\nhope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already\\r\\nso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\nhours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\nthe drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends\\r\\nwith many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen\\r\\nthem so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed\\r\\nbefore the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of conversation\\r\\nwere considerable.  They could describe an entertainment with\\r\\naccuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\r\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\nobject; Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\nand she had something to say to him before he had advanced\\r\\nmany steps.  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\ncongratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said\\r\\nhe was \"very glad\"; but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\nBingley\\'s salutation.  He was full of joy and attention.  The first\\r\\nhalf-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\nfrom the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\nother side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\ndoor.  He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\nelse.  Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\ngreat delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\ncard-table-- but in vain.  She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\nthat Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\neven his open petition rejected.  She assured him that no one\\r\\nintended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\nsubject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\ndo, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\nDarcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\r\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with\\r\\nMiss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s progress through HIS book, as in reading her own;\\r\\nand she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking\\r\\nat his page.  She could not win him, however, to any\\r\\nconversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.  At\\r\\nlength, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her\\r\\nown book, which she had only chosen because it was the second\\r\\nvolume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\\r\\nis to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there is no\\r\\nenjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of anything\\r\\nthan of a book!  When I have a house of my own, I shall be\\r\\nmiserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\nbook, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\namusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\nBennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance\\r\\nat Netherfield?  I would advise you, before you determine on it,\\r\\nto consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if\\r\\nthere are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a\\r\\npunishment than a pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\r\\nchooses, before it begins-- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\r\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I\\r\\nshall send round my cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\r\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.  It\\r\\nwould surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\ndancing were made the order of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\nnot be near so much like a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up\\r\\nand walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she\\r\\nwalked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still\\r\\ninflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings, she\\r\\nresolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,\\r\\nand take a turn about the room.  I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\nafter sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss\\r\\nBingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\nDarcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of\\r\\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\\r\\nunconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join\\r\\ntheir party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine\\r\\nbut two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\\r\\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\\r\\nwould interfere.  \"What could he mean?  She was dying to know\\r\\nwhat could be his meaning?\"-- and asked Elizabeth whether she\\r\\ncould at all understand him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to\\r\\nbe severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be\\r\\nto ask nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.\\r\\nDarcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an\\r\\nexplanation of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he,\\r\\nas soon as she allowed him to speak.  \"You either choose this\\r\\nmethod of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s\\r\\nconfidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are\\r\\nconscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in\\r\\nwalking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if\\r\\nthe second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley.  \"I never heard anything so\\r\\nabominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"We can all plague and punish one another.  Tease him-- laugh\\r\\nat him.  Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT.  I do assure you that my\\r\\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT.  Tease calmness of\\r\\nmanner and presence of mind!  No, no-- feel he may defy us\\r\\nthere.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\\r\\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject.  Mr. Darcy may\\r\\nhug himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"That is an\\r\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,\\r\\nfor it would be a great loss to ME to have many such\\r\\nacquaintances.  I dearly love a laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\r\\nThe wisest and the best of men-- nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\nactions-- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first\\r\\nobject in life is a joke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth-- \"there are such people, but I\\r\\nhope I am not one of THEM.  I hope I never ridicule what is\\r\\nwise and good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and\\r\\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them\\r\\nwhenever I can.  But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\\r\\nare without.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.  But it has been the\\r\\nstudy of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\nstrong understanding to ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride-- where there is a\\r\\nreal superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\nregulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.\\r\\nHe owns it himself without disguise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension.  I have\\r\\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.  My\\r\\ntemper I dare not vouch for.  It is, I believe, too little yielding--\\r\\ncertainly too little for the convenience of the world.  I cannot\\r\\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their\\r\\noffenses against myself.  My feelings are not puffed about with\\r\\nevery attempt to move them.  My temper would perhaps be\\r\\ncalled resentful.  My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\\r\\nresentment IS a shade in a character.  But you have chosen your\\r\\nfault well.  I really cannot LAUGH at it.  You are safe from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\nparticular evil-- a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\neducation can overcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yours, \"he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\\r\\nmisunderstand them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\nconversation in which she had no share.  \"Louisa, you will not\\r\\nmind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not\\r\\nsorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\nmuch attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\nwrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\nmight be sent for them in the course of the day.  But Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at\\r\\nNetherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly\\r\\nfinish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with\\r\\npleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\r\\nleast not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get\\r\\nhome.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly\\r\\nhave the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was\\r\\nadded, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay\\r\\nlonger, she could spare them very well.  Against staying longer,\\r\\nhowever, Elizabeth was positively resolved-- nor did she much\\r\\nexpect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being\\r\\nconsidered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged\\r\\nJane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at\\r\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving\\r\\nNetherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and\\r\\nenough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the\\r\\nfollowing day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going\\r\\nwas deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\\r\\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\\r\\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were\\r\\nto go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that\\r\\nit would not be safe for her-- that she was not enough recovered;\\r\\nbut Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence-- Elizabeth had been\\r\\nat Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he\\r\\nliked-- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more teasing\\r\\nthan usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be particularly\\r\\ncareful that no sign of admiration should NOW escape him,\\r\\nnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his\\r\\nfelicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his\\r\\nbehaviour during the last day must have material weight in\\r\\nconfirming or crushing it.  Steady to his purpose, he scarcely\\r\\nspoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and\\r\\nthough they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour,\\r\\nhe adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not\\r\\neven look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable\\r\\nto almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\nincreased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;\\r\\nand when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it\\r\\nwould always give her to see her either at Longbourn or\\r\\nNetherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\nhands with the former.  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party\\r\\nin the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very\\r\\nwrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have\\r\\ncaught cold again.  But their father, though very laconic in his\\r\\nexpressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt\\r\\ntheir importance in the family circle.  The evening conversation,\\r\\nwhen they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation,\\r\\nand almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass\\r\\nand human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some\\r\\nnew observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine\\r\\nand Lydia had information for them of a different sort.  Much\\r\\nhad been done and much had been said in the regiment since the\\r\\npreceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately\\r\\nwith their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually\\r\\nbeen hinted that colonel Foster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good\\r\\ndinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our\\r\\nfamily party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,\\r\\nI am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in-- And\\r\\nI hope MY dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe\\r\\nshe often sees such at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.  \"A gentleman and a stranger!  It is\\r\\nMr. Bingley, I am sure!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\nto see Mr. Bingley.  But--good Lord! how unlucky!  There is not\\r\\na bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell-- I\\r\\nmust speak to Hill this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom\\r\\nI never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\nbeing eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\nexplained:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\nago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\nrequiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\r\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\r\\npleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that\\r\\nmentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is\\r\\nthe hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed\\r\\naway from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I\\r\\nshould have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\r\\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she\\r\\ncontinued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling and estate\\r\\naway from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom\\r\\nnobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\r\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\nLongbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\nbe a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\\r\\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such\\r\\nfalse friends.  Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as\\r\\nhis father did before him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\nthat head, as you will hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\r\\n                                                   \"15th October.\\r\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\r\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\nhonoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I\\r\\nhave had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to\\r\\nheal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own\\r\\ndoubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for\\r\\nme to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always\\r\\npleased him to be at variance,--  \\'There, Mrs. Bennet.\\'-- My\\r\\nmind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\r\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\r\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose\\r\\nbounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory\\r\\nof this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean\\r\\nmyself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever\\r\\nready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted\\r\\nby the Church of England.  As a clergyman,  moreover, I feel it\\r\\nmy duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all\\r\\nfamilies within in the reach of my influence; and on these\\r\\ngrounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly\\r\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\r\\nentail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.  I\\r\\ncannot otherwise than be concerned at being the means of\\r\\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\r\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every\\r\\npossible amends-- but of this hereafter.  If you should have no\\r\\nobjection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the\\r\\nsatisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\r\\nNovember 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on\\r\\nyour hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight following, which I\\r\\ncan do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from\\r\\nobjecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that\\r\\nsome other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.-- I\\r\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\r\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n                                   \"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\ngentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.  \"He\\r\\nseems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon\\r\\nmy word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\nespecially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\ncome to us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\nand if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\nperson to discourage him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can\\r\\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\ncertainly to his credit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\nand burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she.  \"I cannot make him\\r\\nout.  There is something very pompous in his style.  And what\\r\\ncan he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?  We\\r\\ncannot suppose he would help it if he could.  Could he be a\\r\\nsensible man, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\nquite the reverse.  Thee is a mixture of servility and\\r\\nself-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am\\r\\nimpatient to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\r\\ndefective.  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\nnew, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\nany degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their\\r\\ncousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some\\r\\nweeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a\\r\\nman in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter\\r\\nhad done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see\\r\\nhim with a degree of composure which astonished her husband\\r\\nand daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with\\r\\ngreat politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet indeed said\\r\\nlittle; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins\\r\\nseemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be\\r\\nsilent himself.  He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\nfive-and-twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\nwere very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\ncomplimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\r\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in\\r\\nthis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that\\r\\nhe did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in\\r\\nmarriage.  This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of\\r\\nhis hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no\\r\\ncompliments, answered most readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\nmay prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.  Things are\\r\\nsettled so oddly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\r\\nmust confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with YOU, for such\\r\\nthings I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing\\r\\nhow estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\nappearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young\\r\\nladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will\\r\\nnot say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\non each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collin\\'s\\r\\nadmiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were\\r\\nexamined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\nwould have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\nsupposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.  The\\r\\ndinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to\\r\\nknow to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking\\r\\nwas owing.  But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\r\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to\\r\\nkeep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\\r\\nthe kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her.  In a\\r\\nsoftened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he\\r\\ncontinued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\nservants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\nconversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\\r\\nvery fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s\\r\\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\\r\\nappeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\r\\nbetter.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject\\r\\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a\\r\\nmost important aspect he protested that \"he had never in his life\\r\\nwitnessed such behaviour in a person of rank-- such affability\\r\\nand condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both\\r\\nof the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\r\\npreaching before her.  She had also asked him twice to dine at\\r\\nRosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make\\r\\nup her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady Catherine was\\r\\nreckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never\\r\\nseen anything but affability in her.  She had always spoken to\\r\\nhim as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\nsmallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\nweek or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended\\r\\nto advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose\\r\\nwith discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\nparsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\nhe had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\nherself-- some shelves in the closet upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.  It is a pity that\\r\\ngreat ladies in general are not more like her.  Does she live near\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only\\r\\nby a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?  Has she any family?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\nextensive property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off\\r\\nthan many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  Is she\\r\\nhandsome?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine\\r\\nherself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\nsuperior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\nher features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\nShe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented\\r\\nher from making that progress in many accomplishments which\\r\\nshe could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the\\r\\nlady who superintended her education, and who still resides with\\r\\nthem.  But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\ndrive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among\\r\\nthe ladies at court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\ntown; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\ndeprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.  Her\\r\\nladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that\\r\\nI am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\ncompliments which are always acceptable to ladies.  I have more\\r\\nthan once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming\\r\\ndaughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\r\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be\\r\\nadorned by her.  These are the kind of little things which please\\r\\nher ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself\\r\\npeculiarly bound to pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for\\r\\nyou that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.  May I\\r\\nask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\nof the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\nI sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\nlittle elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\noccasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was\\r\\nas absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\\r\\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most\\r\\nresolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional\\r\\nglance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.\\r\\nBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again,\\r\\nand, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the\\r\\nladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced;\\r\\nbut, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\ncirculating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\nprotested that he never read novels.  Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\nLydia exclaimed.  Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons.  Lydia gaped as he\\r\\nopened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous\\r\\nsolemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning\\r\\naway Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.  My\\r\\naunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton\\r\\nto-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny\\r\\ncomes back from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\nMr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\nbooks of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\\r\\nIt amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so\\r\\nadvantageous to them as instruction.  But I will no longer\\r\\nimportune my young cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\nat backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing\\r\\nthat he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\namusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most\\r\\ncivilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not\\r\\noccur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\nassuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\nshould never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\nat another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for\\r\\nbackgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\nhad been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest\\r\\npart of his life having been spent under the guidance of an\\r\\nilliterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of\\r\\nthe universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without\\r\\nforming at it any useful acquaintance.  The subjection in which\\r\\nhis father had brought him up had given him originally great\\r\\nhumility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by\\r\\nthe self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\nconsequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.  A\\r\\nfortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect\\r\\nwhich he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\npatroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\nauthority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\naltogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness,\\r\\nself-importance and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\\r\\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\\r\\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose\\r\\none of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable\\r\\nas they were represented by common report.  This was his plan\\r\\noff amends-- of atonement-- for inheriting their father\\'s estate;\\r\\nand he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\r\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his\\r\\nown part.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.  Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face\\r\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\nwhat was due to seniority; and for the first evening SHE was his\\r\\nsettled choice.  The next morning, however, made an alteration;\\r\\nfor in a quarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before\\r\\nbreakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,\\r\\nand leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress\\r\\nmight be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid\\r\\nvery complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution\\r\\nagainst the very Jane he had fixed on.  \"As to her YOUNGER\\r\\ndaughters, she could not take upon her to say-- she could not\\r\\npositively answer-- but she did not KNOW of any prepossession;\\r\\nher ELDEST daughter, she must just mention-- she felt it\\r\\nincumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-- and it\\r\\nwas soon done-- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\nElizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\nher of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\nsoon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could\\r\\nnot bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good\\r\\ngraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;\\r\\nevery sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most\\r\\nanxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for\\r\\nthither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he\\r\\nwould continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios\\r\\nin the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\ncessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.  Such doings\\r\\ndiscomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library he had been\\r\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\nhe told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\nroom of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\ncivility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\njoin his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\nmuch better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\npleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The\\r\\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\nhim.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\nquest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\nindeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\nwhom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\nway.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose\\r\\nreturn from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as\\r\\nthey passed.  All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all\\r\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\\r\\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense\\r\\nof wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had\\r\\njust gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back,\\r\\nhad reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly,\\r\\nand entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nwho had returned with him the day before from town, and he\\r\\nwas happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\r\\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only\\r\\nregimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance\\r\\nwas greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a\\r\\nfine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.  The\\r\\nintroduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of\\r\\nconversation-- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\r\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking\\r\\ntogether very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their\\r\\nnotice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\r\\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen\\r\\ncame directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\\r\\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\r\\nprincipal object.  He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn\\r\\non purpose to inquire after her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with\\r\\na bow, an was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on\\r\\nElizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of\\r\\nboth as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the\\r\\neffect of the meeting.  Both changed colour, one looked white,\\r\\nthe other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his\\r\\nhat-- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What\\r\\ncould be the meaning of it?  It was impossible to imagine; it was\\r\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\nnoticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to\\r\\nthe door of Mr. Phillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in\\r\\nspite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they should come\\r\\nin, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\\'s throwing up the parlour\\r\\nwindow and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\neldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\nshe was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\nhome, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\nshould have known nothing about, if she had not happened to\\r\\nsee Mr. Jones\\'s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that\\r\\nthey were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because\\r\\nthe Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was\\r\\nclaimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him.  She\\r\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned\\r\\nwith as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any\\r\\nprevious acquaintance with her, which he could not help\\r\\nflattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship\\r\\nto the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.  Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but\\r\\nher contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\nexclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however,\\r\\nshe could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.\\r\\nDenny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\nlieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire.  She had been watching\\r\\nhim the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,\\r\\nand had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\\r\\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed\\r\\nwindows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison\\r\\nwith the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\"\\r\\nSome of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and\\r\\ntheir aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nand give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\r\\nwould come in the evening.  This was agreed to, and Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy\\r\\ngame of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\\r\\nThe prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted\\r\\nin mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in\\r\\nquitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that\\r\\nthey were perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had\\r\\nseen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would\\r\\nhave defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the\\r\\nwrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\nadmiring Mrs. Phillips\\'s manners and politeness.  He protested\\r\\nthat, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen\\r\\na more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with\\r\\nthe utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\ninvitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\nbefore.  Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\nconnection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\nattention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement\\r\\nwith their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\nsteadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\na suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nhad accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\nseats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\nand he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\napartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed\\r\\nhimself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a\\r\\ncomparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and\\r\\nwho was its proprietor-- when she had listened to the description\\r\\nof only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that\\r\\nthe chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt\\r\\nall the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented\\r\\na comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\nemployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\nconsequence increased with what she heard, and who was\\r\\nresolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she\\r\\ncould.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and\\r\\nwho had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\\r\\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\\r\\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was\\r\\nover at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach, and when\\r\\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had\\r\\nneither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with\\r\\nthe smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of\\r\\nthe ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set,\\r\\nand the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\\r\\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air,\\r\\nand walk, as THEY were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy\\r\\nuncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every\\r\\nfemale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by\\r\\nwhom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in\\r\\nwhich he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only\\r\\non its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest,\\r\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by\\r\\nthe skill of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\nthe officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\nthe young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\nintervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\nwatchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\nobliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be\\r\\nglad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nwas very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first\\r\\nthere seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\nwas a most determined talked; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\nof lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\ngame, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\nhave attention for anyone in particular.  Allowing for the\\r\\ncommon demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at\\r\\nleisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\r\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\r\\ntold-- the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared\\r\\nnot even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity, however, was\\r\\nunexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\\r\\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after\\r\\nreceiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr.\\r\\nDarcy had been staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\nsubject drop, added, \"he is a man of very large property in\\r\\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.  A\\r\\nclear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a\\r\\nperson more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\nhead than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\nparticular manner from my infancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\nafter seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\nmeeting yesterday.  Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly.  \"I\\r\\nhave spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\nvery disagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his\\r\\nbeing agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I\\r\\nhave known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.  It is\\r\\nimpossible for ME to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion of\\r\\nhim would in general astonish-- and perhaps you would not\\r\\nexpress it quite so strongly anywhere else.  Here you are in your\\r\\nown family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in any\\r\\nhouse in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all\\r\\nliked in Hertfordshire.  Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\\r\\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\r\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\nbeyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\\r\\nhappen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\\r\\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\\r\\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n ill-tempered man.\"  Wickham shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going away\\r\\nwhen I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no-- it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.  If\\r\\nHE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go.  We are not on\\r\\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\nhave no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\\r\\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\npainful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthe late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\nand the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\nwith this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\nthousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\ndisgracing  the memory of his father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\\r\\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\nthat he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he\\r\\nadded, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.  I\\r\\nknew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\nDenny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\nquarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\nacquaintances Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is\\r\\nnecessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\nwill not bear solitude.  I MUST have employment and society.\\r\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\nhave now made it eligible.  The church OUGHT to have been\\r\\nmy profession-- I was brought up for the church, and I should at\\r\\nthis time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\npleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation\\r\\nof the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and\\r\\nexcessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.\\r\\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it;\\r\\nbut when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT be?\\r\\nHow could his will be disregarded?  Why did you not seek legal\\r\\nredress?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\nas to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not\\r\\nhave doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it-- or\\r\\nto treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\nthat I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--\\r\\nin short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became\\r\\nvacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and\\r\\nthat it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I\\r\\ncannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve\\r\\nto lose it.  I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\\r\\nspoken my opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely.  I can recall\\r\\nnothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort of\\r\\nmen, and that he hates me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is quite shocking!  He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some time or other he WILL be-- but it shall not be by ME.\\r\\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose HIM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?\\r\\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me-- a dislike which I cannot\\r\\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr.\\r\\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better;\\r\\nbut his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I\\r\\nbelieve, very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\ncompetition in which we stood-- the sort of preference which\\r\\nwas often given me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this-- though I have\\r\\nnever liked him.  I had not thought so very ill of him.  I had\\r\\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but\\r\\ndid not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge,\\r\\nsuch injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I DO\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\ntemper.  His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\ncan hardly be just to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n\"to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of\\r\\nhis father!\"  She could have added, \"a young man, too, like\\r\\nYOU, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\namiable\"-- but she contented herself with, \"and one, too, who\\r\\nhad probably been his companion from childhood, connected\\r\\ntogether, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\ngreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\nsame house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\nparental care.  MY father began life in the profession which your\\r\\nuncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to-- but he\\r\\ngave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and\\r\\ndevoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He\\r\\nwas most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,\\r\\nconfidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be\\r\\nunder the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active\\r\\nsuperintendence, and when, immediately before my father\\'s\\r\\ndeath, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for\\r\\nme, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of\\r\\ngratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"How abominable!  I wonder\\r\\nthat the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to\\r\\nyou!  If from no better motive, that he should not have been too\\r\\nproud to be dishonest-- for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions\\r\\nmay be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\nfeeling.  But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\nto me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\\r\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and\\r\\nrelieve the poor.  Family pride, and FILIAL pride-- for he is very\\r\\nproud of what his father was-- have done this.  Not to appear to\\r\\ndisgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or\\r\\nlose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\\r\\nHe has also BROTHERLY pride, which, with SOME brotherly\\r\\naffection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his\\r\\nsister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most\\r\\nattentive and best of brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.  \"I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives me\\r\\npain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her\\r\\nbrother-- very, very proud.  As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\npleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours\\r\\nand hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.\\r\\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\\r\\nunderstand, highly accomplished.  Since her father\\'s death, her\\r\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\\r\\nsuperintends her education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr.\\r\\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\ntruly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they\\r\\nsuit each other?  Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot\\r\\nknow what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.  He\\r\\ndoes not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\nthinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\nin consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\nless prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\nhe is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\nperhaps agreeable-- allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players\\r\\ngathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station\\r\\nbetween his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.  The usual\\r\\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter.  It had not\\r\\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nbegan to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with\\r\\nmuch earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that\\r\\nhe considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she\\r\\nwould not make herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down\\r\\nto a card table, they must take their chances of these things, and\\r\\nhappily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings\\r\\nany object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the\\r\\nsame, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed\\r\\nfar beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr,.\\r\\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\nfamily of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given\\r\\nhim a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first\\r\\nintroduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her\\r\\nlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\\r\\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the\\r\\npresent Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nconnections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\nand it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\nestates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\nMiss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\nuseless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he\\r\\nwere already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\nand her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\nof her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in\\r\\nspite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\nhave not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that\\r\\nI never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\ninsolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible\\r\\nand clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\nfrom her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\nand the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\nevery one connected with him should have an understanding of\\r\\nthe first class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\\r\\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till\\r\\nsupper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their\\r\\nshare of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions.  There could be no\\r\\nconversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\\'s supper party, but his\\r\\nmanners recommended him to everybody.  Whatever he said,\\r\\nwas said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwent away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nbut of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way\\r\\nhome; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\r\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\\r\\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost\\r\\nand the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the\\r\\ncivility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the\\r\\nleast regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at\\r\\nsupper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had\\r\\nmore to say than he could well manage before the carriage\\r\\nstopped at Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\nMr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\nconcern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be\\r\\nso unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\nnature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\nappearance as Wickham.  The possibility of his having endured\\r\\nsuch unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;\\r\\nand nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of\\r\\nthem both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the\\r\\naccount of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise\\r\\nexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\nway or other, of which we can form no idea.  Interested people\\r\\nhave perhaps misrepresented each to the other.  It is, in short,\\r\\nimpossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances\\r\\nwhich may have alienated them, without actual blame on either\\r\\nside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got\\r\\nto say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\nconcerned in the business?  Do clear THEM too, or we shall be\\r\\nobliged to think ill of somebody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of\\r\\nmy opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a\\r\\ndisgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s\\r\\nfavourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to\\r\\nprovide for.  It is impossible.  No man of common humanity, no\\r\\nman who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\\r\\nCan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\\r\\nOh! no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on,\\r\\nthan that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\nhe gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned\\r\\nwithout ceremony.  If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.\\r\\nBesides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult indeed-- it is distressing.  One does not know what\\r\\nto think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-- that Mr.\\r\\nBingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\nwhen the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery,\\r\\nwhere this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\\r\\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\\r\\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the\\r\\nlong-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the\\r\\nfollowing Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their\\r\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\r\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\\r\\ntheir separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little\\r\\nattention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not\\r\\nmuch to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were\\r\\nsoon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which\\r\\ntook their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to\\r\\nescape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\nevery female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\ngiven in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\nflattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\ninstead of a ceremonious card.  Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\nevening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\nher brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\ngreat deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\neverything in Mr. Darcy\\'s look and behavior.  The happiness\\r\\nanticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\nevent, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\nElizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nhe was be no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\\r\\na ball was, at any rate, a ball.  And even Mary could assure her\\r\\nfamily that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\\r\\nenough-- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\nengagements.  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\none of hose who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\nas desirable for everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she\\r\\ndid not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not\\r\\nhelp asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s\\r\\ninvitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join\\r\\nin the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find\\r\\nthat he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was\\r\\nvery far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a\\r\\nball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\nrespectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\nfrom objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\nthe evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss\\r\\nElizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which\\r\\nI trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to\\r\\nany disrespect for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully\\r\\nproposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances;\\r\\nand to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been\\r\\nworse times.  There was no help for it, however.  Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little\\r\\nlonger, and Mr. Collins\\' proposal accepted with as good a grace\\r\\nas she could.  She was not better the pleased with his gallantry\\r\\nfrom the idea it suggested of something more.  It now first\\r\\nstruck her, that SHE was selected from among her sisters as\\r\\nworthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of\\r\\nassisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of\\r\\nmore eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as\\r\\nshe observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard\\r\\nhis frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and\\r\\nthough more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of\\r\\nher charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to\\r\\nunderstand that the probability of their marriage was extremely\\r\\nagreeable to HER.  Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take\\r\\nthe hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\r\\nconsequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never make the\\r\\noffer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\nof, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\nstate at this time, for form the day of the invitation, to the day of\\r\\nthe ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their\\r\\nwalking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers, no news could\\r\\nbe sought after-- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by\\r\\nproxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\npatience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\nher acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a\\r\\ndance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,\\r\\nSunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\nlooked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\nthere assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\nto her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by\\r\\nany of those recollections that might not unreasonably have\\r\\nalarmed her.  She had dressed with more than usual care, and\\r\\nprepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that\\r\\nremained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more\\r\\nthan might be won in the course of the evening.  But in an\\r\\ninstant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely\\r\\nomitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the\\r\\nofficers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute\\r\\nfact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to\\r\\nwhom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham\\r\\nhad been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and\\r\\nwas not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not\\r\\nimagine his business would have called him away just now, if he\\r\\nhad not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\nless answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\nhad been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\nwas so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\nhardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which\\r\\nhe directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance,\\r\\nforbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She\\r\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\\r\\nturned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not\\r\\nwholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind\\r\\npartiality provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\nprospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\ndwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was\\r\\nsoon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\ncousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The first\\r\\ntwo dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\ndances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\r\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery\\r\\nwhich disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.  The\\r\\nmoment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\ntalking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\nWhen those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas,\\r\\nand was in conversation with her, when she found herself\\r\\nsuddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by\\r\\nsurprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing\\r\\nwhat she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again\\r\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of\\r\\npresence of mind;  Charlotte tried to console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid!  THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\nTo find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate!  Do not\\r\\nwish me such an evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\\r\\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help\\r\\ncautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her\\r\\nfancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of\\r\\na man ten times his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer,\\r\\nand took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she\\r\\nwas arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nand reading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in\\r\\nbeholding it.  They stood for some time without speaking a\\r\\nword; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last\\r\\nthrough the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it;\\r\\ntill suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to\\r\\nher partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight\\r\\nobservation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.\\r\\nAfter a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\r\\nwith:-- \"It is YOUR turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\ntalked about the dance, and YOU ought to make some sort of\\r\\nremark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\nshould be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  That reply will do for the present.  Perhaps by and\\r\\nby I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than\\r\\npublic ones.  But NOW we may be silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look\\r\\nodd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\nadvantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\nthat they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\nyou imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\r\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.  We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down\\r\\nto posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I\\r\\nam sure,\" said he.  \"How near it may be to MINE, I cannot\\r\\npretend to say.  YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\ndown the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\nvery often walk to Meryton?  She answered in the affirmative,\\r\\nand, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us\\r\\nthere the other day, we had just been forming a new\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur\\r\\noverspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth,\\r\\nthough blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\\r\\nAt length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \"Mr.\\r\\nWickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\r\\nMAKING friends-- whether he may be equally capable of\\r\\nRETAINING them, is less certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\nsuffer from all his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\nsubject.  At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\nthem, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\nroom; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\nsuperior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\npartner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.  Such\\r\\nvery superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that you\\r\\nbelong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however, that your\\r\\nfair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have\\r\\nthis pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\nevent, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\ntake place.  What congratulations will then flow in!  I appeal to\\r\\nMr. Darcy:-- but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not\\r\\nthank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\nSir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,\\r\\nand his eyes were directed with a very serious expression\\r\\ntowards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\nRecovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\nand said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what\\r\\nwe were talking of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could not\\r\\nhave interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\nthemselves.  We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Books-- oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with\\r\\nthe same feelings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\nleast be no want of subject.  We may compare our different\\r\\nopinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always\\r\\nfull of something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes-- does it?\"\\r\\nsaid he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\nher thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember\\r\\nhearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\nthat you resentment once created was unappeasable.  You are\\r\\nvery cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING CREATED.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\nopinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\\r\\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity.  \"I am trying to make it\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.  \"I do not get on at all.  I hear such\\r\\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may\\r\\nvary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthat you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\nas there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\ncredit on either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\\r\\nanother opportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly\\r\\nreplied.  She said no more, and they went down the other dance\\r\\nand parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\nan equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable\\r\\npowerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon,\\r\\nand directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards\\r\\nher, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:-- \"So,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\nWickham!  Your sister has been talking to me about him, and\\r\\nasking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\\r\\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he\\r\\nwas the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward.  Let\\r\\nme recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\nconfidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him\\r\\nill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been\\r\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.  I do not know the\\r\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\nleast to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\nmentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could\\r\\nnot well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\nway.  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\nindeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.  I pity you,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\r\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\nsame,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him\\r\\nof nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward,\\r\\nand of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\nsneer.  \"Excuse my interference: it was kindly meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.  \"You are much\\r\\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\\r\\nas this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\nmalice of Mr. Darcy.\"  She then sought her eldest sister, who\\r\\nhas undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\\r\\nJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of\\r\\nsuch happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\nsatisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  Elizabeth instantly\\r\\nread her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham,\\r\\nresentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\r\\nbefore the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\nthan her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.\\r\\nBut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of\\r\\nany third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\nsatisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\r\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good\\r\\nconduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly\\r\\nconvinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention\\r\\nfrom Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by\\r\\nhis account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a\\r\\nrespectable young man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent,\\r\\nand has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\nam satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\nheard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that\\r\\nit was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth\\r\\nwarmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by\\r\\nassurances only.  Mr. Bingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very\\r\\nable one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several\\r\\nparts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend\\r\\nhimself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\nand on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\\r\\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest\\r\\nhopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard, and said\\r\\nall in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being\\r\\njoined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss\\r\\nLucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner\\r\\nshe had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\r\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so\\r\\nfortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is\\r\\nnow in the room a near relation of my patroness.  I happened to\\r\\noverhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady\\r\\nwho does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss\\r\\nde Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How\\r\\nwonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have\\r\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh in his assembly!  I am most thankful that\\r\\nthe discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,\\r\\nwhich I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not\\r\\nhaving done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection\\r\\nmust plead my apology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I am.  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\nearlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s NEPHEW.  It will\\r\\nbe in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\nyesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\\r\\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him\\r\\nwithout introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a\\r\\ncompliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary\\r\\nthere should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it\\r\\nmust belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin\\r\\nthe acquaintance.  Mr. Collins listened to her with the\\r\\ndetermined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\r\\nceased speaking, replied thus:-- \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have\\r\\nthe highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in\\r\\nall matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit\\r\\nme to say, that there must be a wide difference between the\\r\\nestablished forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\\r\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I\\r\\nconsider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the\\r\\nhighest rank in the kingdom-- provided that a proper humility of\\r\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\\r\\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\\r\\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point\\r\\nof duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,\\r\\nwhich on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\\r\\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\r\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady\\r\\nlike yourself.\"  And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched,\\r\\nand whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\r\\nHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though\\r\\nshe could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and\\r\\nsaw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\"\\r\\nand \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"  It vexed her to see him\\r\\nexpose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\nunrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\ntime to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.  Mr. Collins,\\r\\nhowever, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\nof his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\nslight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then returned\\r\\nto Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with\\r\\nmy reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\nattention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\\r\\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never\\r\\nbestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome\\r\\nthought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,\\r\\nshe turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\nBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\nobservations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\nJane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\nfelicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\nfelt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\nlike Bingley\\'s two sisters.  Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\nwere bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\nher, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat down to\\r\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness\\r\\nwhich placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she\\r\\nvexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person\\r\\n(Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her\\r\\nexpectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.  It\\r\\nwas an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\\r\\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.  His\\r\\nbeing such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\r\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\\r\\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters\\r\\nwere of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\\r\\nconnection as much as she could do.  It was, moreover, such a\\r\\npromising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so\\r\\ngreatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly,\\r\\nit was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her\\r\\nsingle daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be\\r\\nobliged to go into company more than she liked.  It was\\r\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure,\\r\\nbecause on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less\\r\\nlikely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any\\r\\nperiod of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that\\r\\nLady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate,  though evidently\\r\\nand triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\nmother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less\\r\\naudible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could\\r\\nperceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who\\r\\nsat opposite to them.  Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\nnonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\\r\\nI am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\nto say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it\\r\\nbe for you to offend Mr. Darcy?  You will never recommend\\r\\nyourself to his friend by so doing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.  Her\\r\\nmother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\nElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\\r\\nShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nthough every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for\\r\\nthough he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The\\r\\nexpression of his face changed gradually from indignant\\r\\ncontempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\nLucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\nwhich she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\nof cold ham and chicken.  Elizabeth now began to revive.  But\\r\\nnot long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was\\r\\nover, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of\\r\\nseeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\ncompany.  By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did\\r\\nshe endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in\\r\\nvain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\r\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations,\\r\\nand she watched her progress through the several stanzas with\\r\\nan impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\\r\\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a\\r\\nhope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after\\r\\nthe pause of half a minute began another.  Mary\\'s powers were\\r\\nby no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and\\r\\nher manner affected.  Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at\\r\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\r\\ntalking to Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them\\r\\nmaking signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who\\r\\ncontinued, however, imperturbably grave.  She looked at her\\r\\nfather to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all\\r\\nnight.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second\\r\\nsong, said aloud, \"That will do extremely well, child.  You have\\r\\ndelighted us long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time\\r\\nto exhibit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\\r\\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her\\r\\nfather\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\\r\\nOthers of the party were now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing,\\r\\nI should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company\\r\\nwith an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion,\\r\\nand perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.  I\\r\\ndo not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in\\r\\ndevoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly\\r\\nother things to be attended to.  The rector of a parish has much\\r\\nto do.  In the first place, he must make such an agreement for\\r\\ntithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his\\r\\npatron.  He must write his own sermons; and the time that\\r\\nremains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\r\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused\\r\\nfrom making as a comfortable as a possible.  And I do not think\\r\\nit of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\nconciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards\\r\\nthose to whom he owes his preferment.  I cannot acquit him of\\r\\nthat duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\r\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected\\r\\nwith the family.\"  And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\r\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as a to be heard by\\r\\nhalf the room.  Many stared-- many smiled; but no one looked\\r\\nmore amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously\\r\\ncommended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and\\r\\nobserved in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a\\r\\nremarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\nto expose themselves as a much as a they could during the\\r\\nevening, it would have been impossible for them to play their\\r\\nparts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it\\r\\nfor Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had\\r\\nescaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be\\r\\nmuch distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\\r\\nThat his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such\\r\\nan opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and\\r\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\r\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more\\r\\nintolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was\\r\\nteased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\nside, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\nagain, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did\\r\\nshe entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\nintroduce him to any young lady in the room.  He assured her,\\r\\nthat as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his\\r\\nchief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close\\r\\nto her the whole evening.  There was no arguing upon such a\\r\\nproject.  She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,\\r\\nwho often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\'s further\\r\\nnotice; though often standing within a very short distance of her,\\r\\nquite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.  She felt\\r\\nit to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\nand, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\ncarriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\nwhich gave them time to see how heartily they were wished\\r\\naway by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely\\r\\nopened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were\\r\\nevidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They\\r\\nrepulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by\\r\\nso doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very\\r\\nlittle relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was\\r\\ncomplimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of\\r\\ntheir entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had\\r\\nmarked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all.\\r\\nMr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.  Mr.\\r\\nBingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from\\r\\nthe rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth preserved as\\r\\nsteady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even\\r\\nLydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional\\r\\nexclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a\\r\\nviolent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\npressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\nLongbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\nassure him how happy he would make them by eating a family\\r\\ndinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\ninvitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\nengaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\nafter his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\nnext day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\nthe delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\npreparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\nshe should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\nthe course of three or four months.  Of having another daughter\\r\\nmarried to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\nwith considerable, though not equal, pleasure.  Elizabeth was the\\r\\nleast dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\nmatch were quite good enough for HER, the worth of each was\\r\\neclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmade his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without\\r\\nloss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the\\r\\nfollowing Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make\\r\\nit distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\nvery orderly manner, with all the observances, which he\\r\\nsupposed a regular part of the business.  On finding Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\r\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \"May I\\r\\nhope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\nElizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\nwith her in the course of this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!-- yes-- certainly.  I\\r\\nam sure Lizzy will be very happy-- I am sure she can have no\\r\\nobjection, Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"  And, gathering\\r\\nher work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\r\\ncalled out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam, do not go.  I beg you will not go.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmust excuse me.  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody\\r\\nneed not hear.  I am going away myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.  I desire you to stay where you are.\"\\r\\nAnd upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and\\r\\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\\r\\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth would not oppose such and injunction-- and a\\r\\nmoment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would\\r\\nbe wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat\\r\\ndown again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the\\r\\nfeelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were\\r\\ngone, Mr. Collins began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\nfrom doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\nperfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\nthere NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure\\r\\nyou, that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this\\r\\naddress.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\nhowever your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\nattentions have been too marked to be mistaken.  Almost as\\r\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion\\r\\nof my future life.  But before I am run away with by my feelings\\r\\non this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state\\r\\nmy reasons for marrying-- and, moreover, for coming into\\r\\nHertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being\\r\\nrun away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing,\\r\\nthat she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt\\r\\nto stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing\\r\\nfor every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set\\r\\nthe example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\nconvinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\nthirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\nis the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\nlady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has\\r\\nshe condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\nHunsford-- between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson\\r\\nwas arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said,  \\'Mr.\\r\\nCollins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you must marry.\\r\\nChoose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY sake; and for\\r\\nyour OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought\\r\\nup high, but able to make a small income go a good way.  This is\\r\\nmy advice.  Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to\\r\\nHunsford, and I will visit her.\\'  Allow me, by the way, to\\r\\nobserve, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\r\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\r\\nadvantages in my power to offer.  You will find her manners\\r\\nbeyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I\\r\\nthink, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with\\r\\nthe silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\\r\\nThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it\\r\\nremains to be told why my views were directed towards\\r\\nLongbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can\\r\\nassure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact\\r\\nis, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of\\r\\nyour honoured father (who, however, may live many years\\r\\nlonger), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a\\r\\nwife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as\\r\\nlittle as possible, when the melancholy event takes place-- which,\\r\\nhowever, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\\r\\nThis has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it\\r\\nwill not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing remains but\\r\\nfor me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\r\\nviolence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent,\\r\\nand shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I\\r\\nam well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one\\r\\nthousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours\\r\\ntill after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be\\r\\nentitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent;\\r\\nand you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall\\r\\never pass my lips when we are married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried.  \"You forget that I have\\r\\nmade no answer.  Let me do it without further loss of time.\\r\\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.  I am\\r\\nvery sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\nof the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\naddresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when\\r\\nhe first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\nrepeated a second, or even a third time.  I am therefore by no\\r\\nmeans discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\nlead you to the altar ere long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\r\\nextraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that I\\r\\nam not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\nwho are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\nbeing asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\nYou could not make ME happy, and I am convinced that I am\\r\\nthe last woman in the world who could make you so.  Nay, were\\r\\nyour friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she\\r\\nwould find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr.\\r\\nCollins very gravely-- \"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\nwould at all disapprove of you.  And you may be certain when I\\r\\nhave the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\nhighest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\nqualification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.  You\\r\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\\r\\ncompliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and\\r\\nvery rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to\\r\\nprevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must\\r\\nhave satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my\\r\\nfamily, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever\\r\\nit falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be\\r\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\"  And rising as she thus\\r\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not\\r\\nthus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\nsubject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\nyou have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\ncruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\ncustom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\nperhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit\\r\\nas would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you\\r\\npuzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can appear\\r\\nto you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express\\r\\nmy refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\nyour refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My\\r\\nreasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\nme that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the\\r\\nestablishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\ndesirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the family of\\r\\nde Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\nhighly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by\\r\\nno means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\nmade you.  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\nlikelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\nqualifications.  As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\nserious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to\\r\\nyour wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\nusual practice of elegant females.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that\\r\\nkind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\\r\\nI would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\\r\\nI thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in\\r\\nyour proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.  My\\r\\nfeelings in every respect forbid it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not\\r\\nconsider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you,\\r\\nbut as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\nexpress authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\nwill not fail of being acceptable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\nmake no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew,\\r\\ndetermined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated\\r\\nrefusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,\\r\\nwhose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be\\r\\ndecisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for\\r\\nthe affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\nvestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\nElizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards\\r\\nthe staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and\\r\\ncongratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy\\r\\nprospect or their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and\\r\\nreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\r\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\\r\\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied,\\r\\nsince the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him\\r\\nwould naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine\\r\\ndelicacy of her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would\\r\\nhave been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had\\r\\nmeant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but\\r\\nshe dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall\\r\\nbe brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it directly.  She\\r\\nis a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\ninterest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins;\\r\\n\"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether\\r\\nshe would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\nsituation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\nstate.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\nperhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\nbecause if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\ncontribute much to my felicity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n\"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In everything\\r\\nelse she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go directly\\r\\nto Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\nher husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr.\\r\\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\r\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows\\r\\nshe will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will\\r\\nchange his mind and not have HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\nfixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in\\r\\nthe least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when\\r\\nshe had finished her speech.  \"Of what are you talking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\nLizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?  It seems an hopeless\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\nher marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\\r\\nthe library.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared.  \"I have\\r\\nsent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.\\r\\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?\"  Elizabeth\\r\\nreplied that it was.  \"Very well-- and this offer of marriage you\\r\\nhave refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists\\r\\nupon your accepting it.  Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day\\r\\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.  Your mother will\\r\\nnever see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\nnever see you again if you DO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\nbeginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\nhusband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?  You\\r\\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to\\r\\nrequest.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\nunderstanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\\r\\nroom.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\\r\\nmay be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\nand again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.  She endeavoured\\r\\nto secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\nmildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\nreal earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\nher attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her\\r\\ndetermination never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\npassed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\nmotives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\nhurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite\\r\\nimaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s\\r\\nreproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\nspend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\nwho, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are\\r\\ncome, for there is such fun here!  What do you think has\\r\\nhappened this morning?  Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,\\r\\nand she will not have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\nentered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than\\r\\nshe likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\ncompassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\ncomply with the wishes of all her family.  \"Pray do, my dear\\r\\nMiss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on\\r\\nmy side, nobody takes part with me.  I am cruelly used, nobody\\r\\nfeels for my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as\\r\\nunconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we\\r\\nwere at York, provided she can have her own way.  But I tell\\r\\nyou, Miss Lizzy-- if you take it into your head to go on refusing\\r\\nevery offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband\\r\\nat all-- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  I shall not be able to keep you--\\r\\nand so I warn you.  I have done with you from this very day.  I\\r\\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to\\r\\nyou again, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no\\r\\npleasure in talking to undutiful children.  Not that I have much\\r\\npleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I\\r\\ndo from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for\\r\\ntalking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer!  But it is always so.\\r\\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\\r\\nincrease the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without\\r\\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\\r\\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than\\r\\nusual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I do\\r\\ninsist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me\\r\\nand Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\nfollowed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\ncould; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nwhose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute,\\r\\nand then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the\\r\\nwindow and pretending not to hear.  In a doleful voice Mrs.\\r\\nBennet began the projected conversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam, \" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this\\r\\npoint.  Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that\\r\\nmarked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\\r\\nResignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the\\r\\npeculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\nhave been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\\r\\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive\\r\\nhappiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\r\\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when\\r\\nthe blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\nestimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\ndisrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\\r\\nmy pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid\\r\\nyourself and Mr. Bennet to compliment of requesting you to\\r\\ninterpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear,\\r\\nbe objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to\\r\\nerror.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My\\r\\nobject has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\ndue consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\nMANNER has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\napologise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\nand Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\nnecessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\nallusions of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself, HIS\\r\\nfeelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\ndejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\nand resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\r\\nespecially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill-humour\\r\\nor ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\npride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\nvisit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.  He\\r\\nwas always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\nto stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.\\r\\nWickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from\\r\\nthe Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the town,\\r\\nand attended them to their aunt\\'s where his regret and vexation,\\r\\nand the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To\\r\\nElizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\\r\\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\nmeet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party\\r\\nwith him for so many hours together, might be more than I could\\r\\nbear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\nfull discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\ncivilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\nwalked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\nparticularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a\\r\\ndouble advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to\\r\\nherself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing\\r\\nhim to her father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it\\r\\ncame from Netherfield.  The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\nelegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair,\\r\\nflowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change\\r\\nas she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular\\r\\npassages.  Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter\\r\\naway, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general\\r\\nconversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which\\r\\ndrew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had\\r\\nhe and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\r\\ninvited her to follow her upstairs.  When they had gained their\\r\\nown room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, \"This is from\\r\\nCaroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\r\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\r\\ntheir way to town-- and without any intention of coming back\\r\\nagain.  You shall hear what she says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\ninformation of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\nto town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was in these\\r\\nwords: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\nHertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\nwill hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\nunreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that.\"  To\\r\\nthese highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\ninsensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\nremoval surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\nwas not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield\\r\\nwould prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of\\r\\ntheir society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard\\r\\nit, in the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should\\r\\nnot be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\nBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to\\r\\nwhich Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is\\r\\naware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as\\r\\nfriends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\\r\\nMr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\nHertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\\r\\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in three\\r\\nor four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the\\r\\nsame time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be\\r\\nin no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following\\r\\nhim thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours\\r\\nin a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintances are already\\r\\nthere for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest\\r\\nfriend, had any intention of making one of the crowd-- but of\\r\\nthat I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire\\r\\nmay abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings,\\r\\nand that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your\\r\\nfeeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more\\r\\nthis winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\nSHOULD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing.  He is his\\r\\nown master.  But you do not know ALL.  I WILL read you the\\r\\npassage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves\\r\\nfrom YOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\ntruth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do\\r\\nnot think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\nand accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa\\r\\nand myself is heightened into something still more interesting,\\r\\nfrom the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our\\r\\nsister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you\\r\\nmy feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country\\r\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\r\\nunreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already; he will\\r\\nhave frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most\\r\\nintimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as\\r\\nhis own; and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think,\\r\\nwhen I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s\\r\\nheart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and\\r\\nnothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging\\r\\nthe hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said\\r\\nJane as she finished it.  \"Is it not clear enough?  Does it not\\r\\nexpressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\nbe her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s\\r\\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for\\r\\nhim, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?  Can\\r\\nthere be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.  Will you hear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall have it in a few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\nbrother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\nShe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\nto persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.  No one who has ever\\r\\nseen you together can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley, I am\\r\\nsure, cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen\\r\\nhalf as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have\\r\\nordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this: We are not\\r\\nrich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more\\r\\nanxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\r\\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\\r\\ntrouble in achieving a second: in which there is certainly some\\r\\ningenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nwere out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously\\r\\nimagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly\\r\\nadmires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of\\r\\nYOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or\\r\\nthat it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being\\r\\nin love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\r\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.  But I know\\r\\nthe foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\ndeceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she\\r\\nis deceiving herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right.  You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\nsince you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to be\\r\\ndeceived, by all means.  You have now done your duty by her,\\r\\nand must fret no longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\nmarry elsewhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon\\r\\nmature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\ntwo sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\nwife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling.  \"You must\\r\\nknow that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\ndisapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\nconsider your situation with much compassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\nutmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\nCaroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\nsuppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\ncould influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\r\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy\\r\\neffect.  Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure\\r\\nof the family, without being alarmed on the score of the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave\\r\\nher a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly\\r\\nunlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they\\r\\nwere all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it,\\r\\nhowever, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\r\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at\\r\\nLongbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable\\r\\ndeclaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\\r\\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\nduring the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to\\r\\nMr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.  \"It\\r\\nkeeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to\\r\\nyou than I can express.\"  Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\nsatisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the\\r\\nlittle sacrifice of her time.  This was very amiable, but\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\nconception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\ntowards herself.  Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and\\r\\nappearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night,\\r\\nshe would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been\\r\\nto leave Hertfordshire so very soon.  But here she did injustice\\r\\nto the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to\\r\\nescape out of Longbourn House the next morning with\\r\\nadmirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself\\r\\nat her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\r\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail\\r\\nto conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the\\r\\nattempt known till its success might be known likewise; for\\r\\nthough feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had\\r\\nbeen tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since\\r\\nthe adventure of Wednesday.  His reception, however, was of\\r\\nthe most flattering kind.  Miss Lucas perceived him from an\\r\\nupper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set\\r\\nout to meet him accidentally in the lane.  But little had she dared\\r\\nto hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow,\\r\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\nand as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\nthe day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though\\r\\nsuch a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt\\r\\nno inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The stupidity with\\r\\nwhich he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from\\r\\nany charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance;\\r\\nand Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\r\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\r\\nestablishment were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\nconsent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.  Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\ntheir daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\nprospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nbegan directly to calculate, with more interest than the\\r\\nmatter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.\\r\\nBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\r\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\nhis wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole\\r\\nfamily, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The\\r\\nyounger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two\\r\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were\\r\\nrelieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old\\r\\nmaid.  Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.  She had\\r\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it.  Her reflections\\r\\nwere in general satisfactory.  Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\nsensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\nattachment to her must be imaginary.  But still he would be her\\r\\nhusband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\nmarriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\nfor well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\npreservative from want.  This preservative she had now\\r\\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\\r\\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The least\\r\\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must\\r\\noccasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued\\r\\nbeyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would wonder, and\\r\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to\\r\\nbe shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\\r\\nShe resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore\\r\\ncharged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\\r\\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.  A\\r\\npromise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it\\r\\ncould not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by\\r\\nhis long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his\\r\\nreturn as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\r\\npublish his prosperous love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see\\r\\nany of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed\\r\\nwhen the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with\\r\\ngreat politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to\\r\\nsee him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might\\r\\nallow him to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\r\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no\\r\\nmeans wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation\\r\\nhere, my good sir?  You had better neglect your relations than\\r\\nrun the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly obliged to\\r\\nyou for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\ntaking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.  Risk anything\\r\\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\nyour coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\nprobable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall\\r\\ntake no offence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited, by\\r\\nsuch affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\nreceive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\nmark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my\\r\\nfair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to\\r\\nrender it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them\\r\\nhealth and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\nequally surprised that he meditated a quick return.  Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\naddresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\nprevailed on to accept him.  She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\nthan any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\nwhich often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\nherself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\nhimself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\nagreeable companion.  But on the following morning, every\\r\\nhope of this kind was done away.  Miss Lucas called soon after\\r\\nbreakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the\\r\\nevent of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying herself in love with her\\r\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two;\\r\\nbut that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\nfrom possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\nthe bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins!  My dear Charlotte-- impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in\\r\\ntelling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on\\r\\nreceiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than\\r\\nshe expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?  Do you think it\\r\\nincredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any\\r\\nwoman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\\r\\nsucceed with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\neffort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the\\r\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that\\r\\nshe wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte.  \"You must be\\r\\nsurprised, very much surprised-- so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\nwishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think it\\r\\nover, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.  I am\\r\\nnot romantic, you know; I never was.  I ask only a comfortable\\r\\nhome; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connection, and\\r\\nsituation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\nwith him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\nmarriage state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly\"; and after an\\r\\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\\r\\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left\\r\\nto reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before she\\r\\nbecame at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\\r\\nThe strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage\\r\\nwithin three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\r\\naccepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of\\r\\nmatrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not\\r\\nsupposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she\\r\\nwould have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\\r\\nCharlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!\\r\\nAnd to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her\\r\\nesteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was\\r\\nimpossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\r\\nchosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\nmention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\ndaughter, to announce her engagement to the family.  With many\\r\\ncompliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect\\r\\nof a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter-- to\\r\\nan audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he\\r\\nmust be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\r\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?  Do not\\r\\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have\\r\\nborne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good\\r\\nbreeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave\\r\\nto be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\ntheir impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\nunpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\naccount, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\nherself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\nmother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\nSir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\nmaking a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\nexpected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nand the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great\\r\\ndeal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them\\r\\nthan her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she\\r\\npersisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\nwas very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\ntrusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\nthat the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however,\\r\\nwere plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was\\r\\nthe real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had\\r\\nbeen barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points\\r\\nshe principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could\\r\\nconsole and nothing could appease her.  Nor did that day wear\\r\\nout her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see\\r\\nElizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she\\r\\ncould speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude,\\r\\nand many months were gone before she could at all forgive her\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the\\r\\noccasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of\\r\\na most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover\\r\\nthat Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\nsensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\ndaughter!\\r\\n\\r\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\r\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their\\r\\nhappiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as\\r\\nimprobable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\nfor Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\nother way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\nretort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\nmarried; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual\\r\\nto say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and\\r\\nill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which\\r\\nkept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt\\r\\npersuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between\\r\\nthem again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with\\r\\nfonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she\\r\\nwas sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose\\r\\nhappiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been\\r\\ngone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\nTuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\nsolemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the\\r\\nfamily might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience\\r\\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\nexpressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\ntheir amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\nwas merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\r\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\\r\\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\nfortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved\\r\\nhis marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\nwhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\namiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\ndisposed to complain of it as her husband.  It was very strange\\r\\nthat he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\nwas also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.  She\\r\\nhated having visitors in the house while her health was so\\r\\nindifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\\r\\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave\\r\\nway only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued\\r\\nabsence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\\r\\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of\\r\\nhim than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his\\r\\ncoming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which\\r\\nhighly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to\\r\\ncontradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear-- not that Bingley was indifferent--\\r\\nbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s\\r\\nhappiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\ncould not prevent its frequently occurring.  The united efforts of\\r\\nhis two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted\\r\\nby the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London\\r\\nmight be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\nattachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\nmore painful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\ndesirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\ntherefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such\\r\\ndelicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\nshe did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival,\\r\\nor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she\\r\\nwould think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane\\'s steady\\r\\nmildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but\\r\\nhis reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had\\r\\nbeen on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to\\r\\nneed much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\nlove-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\\r\\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\nsometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an\\r\\napology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very\\r\\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\\r\\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of\\r\\nhearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\\r\\nAs her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\nabhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she\\r\\nconcluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\r\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was\\r\\nconvinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\\r\\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\\r\\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all\\r\\nthis to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I\\r\\nshould be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take\\r\\nher place in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us\\r\\nhope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\\r\\nthe survivor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\\r\\nof making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.  If it\\r\\nwas not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\ninsensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\nentail.  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\nestate from one\\'s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all\\r\\nfor the sake of Mr. Collins too!  Why should HE have it more\\r\\nthan anybody else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very\\r\\nfirst sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in\\r\\nLondon for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret\\r\\nat not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\nHertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection\\r\\nof the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy\\'s\\r\\npraise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again\\r\\ndwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing\\r\\nintimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the\\r\\nwishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.  She wrote\\r\\nalso with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the\\r\\nlatter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of\\r\\nall this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided\\r\\nbetween concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\\r\\nTo Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss\\r\\nDarcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she\\r\\ndoubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\nalways been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\nanger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\nwant of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\ndesigning friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\nto the caprice of their inclination.  Had his own happiness,\\r\\nhowever, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s\\r\\nwas involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.  It\\r\\nwas a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long\\r\\nindulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nelse; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or\\r\\nwere suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had\\r\\nbeen aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\nmust be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s\\r\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\nfeelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them\\r\\ntogether, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\nand its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!  She\\r\\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\nreflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.  He\\r\\nwill be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\nsaid nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you\\r\\nhave no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable\\r\\nman of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either to\\r\\nhope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I\\r\\nhave not THAT pain. A little time, therefore-- I shall certainly\\r\\ntry to get the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\\r\\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\nmy side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.  Your\\r\\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\nwhat to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\nloved you as you deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and\\r\\nthrew back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.  YOU wish to think all\\r\\nthe world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I\\r\\nonly want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it.\\r\\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\nencroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.  You need\\r\\nnot.  There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\nwhom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\ndissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\ninconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\ndependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\nsense.  I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\nmention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage.  It is unaccountable!\\r\\nIn every view it is unaccountable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.  They\\r\\nwill ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough\\r\\nfor difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins\\'s\\r\\nrespectability, and Charlotte\\'s steady, prudent character.\\r\\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it\\r\\nis a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\\'s\\r\\nsake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our\\r\\ncousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\none else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\npersuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\nthink worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\\r\\nMy dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-\\r\\nminded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must\\r\\nfeel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot\\r\\nhave a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though\\r\\nit is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one\\r\\nindividual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\\r\\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is\\r\\nprudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I musty think your language too strong in speaking of both,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\nthem happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to\\r\\nsomething else.  You mentioned TWO instances.  I cannot\\r\\nmisunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me\\r\\nby thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion\\r\\nof him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves\\r\\nintentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to\\r\\nbe always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing\\r\\nbut our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration\\r\\nmeans more than it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no\\r\\nidea of there being so much design in the world as some persons\\r\\nimagine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to\\r\\ndesign,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or\\r\\nto make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be\\r\\nmisery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s\\r\\nfeelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying\\r\\nwhat I think of persons you esteem Stop me whilst you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?\\r\\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\nother woman can secure it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides\\r\\nhis happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\nconsequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\nimportance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\nsupposing.  They have known her much longer than they have\\r\\nknown me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever\\r\\nmay be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have\\r\\nopposed their brother\\'s.  What sister would think herself at\\r\\nliberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\\r\\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part\\r\\nus; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an\\r\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong,\\r\\nand me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not\\r\\nashamed of having been mistaken-- or, at least, it is light, it is\\r\\nnothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him\\r\\nor his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in the light in\\r\\nwhich it may be understood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\nBingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\nnot account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\nconsidering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\nconvince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\nattentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\ntransient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\nthough the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\nshe had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s best\\r\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  \"So, Lizzy,\" said he\\r\\none day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find.  I congratulate\\r\\nher.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in\\r\\nlove now and then.  It is something to think of, and it gives her a\\r\\nsort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to\\r\\ncome?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is\\r\\nyour time.  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\nthe young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be your man.  He\\r\\nis a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.  We\\r\\nmust not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\\r\\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\nmother who will make the most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many\\r\\nof the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\nrecommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\\r\\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on\\r\\nMr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now\\r\\nopenly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody\\r\\nwas pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\\r\\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there\\r\\nmight be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to\\r\\nthe society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\npleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--\\r\\nbut by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\r\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival\\r\\nof Saturday.  The pain of separation, however, might be\\r\\nalleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his\\r\\nbride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into\\r\\nHertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.  He took leave of his relations at Longbourn\\r\\nwith as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health\\r\\nand happiness again, and promised their father another letter of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\nthe Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\nnature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\nview of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\nagreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent,\\r\\nelegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn\\r\\nnieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there\\r\\nsubsisted a particular regard.  They had frequently been staying\\r\\nwith her in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to\\r\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.  When\\r\\nthis was done she had a less active part to play.  It became her\\r\\nturn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\nmuch to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\nlast saw her sister.  Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\nmarriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got\\r\\nMr. Bingley if she could.  But Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  It is very hard\\r\\nto think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time,\\r\\nhad it not been for her own perverseness.  He made her an offer\\r\\nin this very room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is,\\r\\nthat Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and\\r\\nthat the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.  The\\r\\nLucases are very artful people indeed, sister.  They are all for\\r\\nwhat they can get.  I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It\\r\\nmakes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own\\r\\nfamily, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before\\r\\nanybody else.  However, your coming just at this time is the\\r\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us,\\r\\nof long sleeves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\nbefore, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence\\r\\nwith her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to\\r\\nher nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\nsubject.  \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\nJane,\" said she.  \"I am sorry it went off.  But these things happen\\r\\nso often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\neasily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\naccident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of\\r\\ninconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will\\r\\nnot do for US.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does not often\\r\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young\\r\\nman of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he\\r\\nwas violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\r\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.  It is as\\r\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.  Pray, how\\r\\nVIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every\\r\\ntime they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At his own\\r\\nball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them\\r\\nto dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\nanswer. Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility\\r\\nthe very essence of love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\nPoor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\nmay not get over it immediately.  It had better have happened to\\r\\nYOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\nBut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with\\r\\nus?  Change of scene might be of service-- and perhaps a little\\r\\nrelief from home may be as useful as anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\npersuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\\r\\nregard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so\\r\\ndifferent a part of town, all our connections are so different, and,\\r\\nas you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable\\r\\nthat they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\nhis friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\nJane in such a part of London!  My dear aunt, how could you\\r\\nthink of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a\\r\\nplace as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a\\r\\nmonth\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were\\r\\nhe once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs\\r\\nwithout him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But does\\r\\nnot Jane correspond with his sister?  SHE will not be able to\\r\\nhelp calling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place\\r\\nthis point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s\\r\\nbeing withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the\\r\\nsubject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not\\r\\nconsider it entirely hopeless.  It was possible, and sometimes she\\r\\nthought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and\\r\\nthe influence of his friends successfully combated by the more\\r\\nnatural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and\\r\\nthe Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time,\\r\\nthan as she hoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house\\r\\nwith her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with\\r\\nher, without any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\nPhillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\nwithout its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided\\r\\nfor the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\nonce sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was for\\r\\nhome, some of the officers always made part of it-- of which\\r\\nofficers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these\\r\\noccasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both.  Without\\r\\nsupposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,\\r\\ntheir preference of each other was plain enough to make her a\\r\\nlittle uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the\\r\\nsubject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\nimprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording\\r\\npleasure, unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a\\r\\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\\r\\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he\\r\\nbelonged.  They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common;\\r\\nand though Wickham had been little there since the death of\\r\\nDarcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\r\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\r\\nprocuring.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberly, and known the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\nby character perfectly well.  Here consequently was an\\r\\ninexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her recollection\\r\\nof Pemberly with the minute description which Wickham could\\r\\ngive, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of\\r\\nits late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.  On\\r\\nbeing made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment\\r\\nof him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s reputed\\r\\ndisposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was\\r\\nconfident at last that she recollected having heard Mr.\\r\\nFitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\ngiven on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\nalone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\r\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of\\r\\nspeaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.\\r\\nDo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\naffection which the want of fortune would make so very\\r\\nimprudent.  I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most\\r\\ninteresting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to\\r\\nhave, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is, you\\r\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.  You have sense, and\\r\\nwe all expect you to use it.  Your father would depend on\\r\\nYOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You must not\\r\\ndisappoint your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care of\\r\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love with\\r\\nme, if I can prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again.  At present I am not in love\\r\\nwith Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is, beyond all\\r\\ncomparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw-- and if he\\r\\nbecomes really attached to me-- I believe it will be better that he\\r\\nshould not.  I see the imprudence of it.  Oh! THAT abominable\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest\\r\\nhonour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.  My father,\\r\\nhowever, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my dear aunt, I\\r\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you\\r\\nunhappy; but since we see every day that where there is\\r\\naffection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want\\r\\nof fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how\\r\\ncan I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if\\r\\nI am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be\\r\\nwisdom  to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\r\\nto be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\r\\nobject.  When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\\r\\nIn short, I will do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\nvery often.  At least, you should not REMIND you mother of\\r\\ninviting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n\"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.  But do\\r\\nnot imagine that he is always here so often.  It is on your\\r\\naccount that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You\\r\\nknow my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\nfor her friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\nwhat I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\nher for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\ninstance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\nresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\nquitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\nwith the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\nBennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\nlength so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\nrepeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \"WISHED they\\r\\nmight be happy.\"  Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\nWednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\r\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s\\r\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected\\r\\nherself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went\\r\\ndownstairs together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you.  Will you come and see\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me,\\r\\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\nthe visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\\r\\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\\r\\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding took place:  the bride and bridegroom set off for\\r\\nKent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say,\\r\\nor to hear, on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from\\r\\nher friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent\\r\\nas it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\nimpossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\nthat all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\nnot to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\nhad been, rather than what was.  Charlotte\\'s first letters were\\r\\nreceived with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how\\r\\nshe would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare\\r\\npronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read,\\r\\nElizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point\\r\\nexactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote cheerfully,\\r\\nseemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which\\r\\nshe could not praise.  The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\r\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was\\r\\nmost friendly and obliging.  It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of\\r\\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth\\r\\nperceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\ntheir safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\nhoped it would be in her power to say something of the\\r\\nBingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\nimpatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\neither seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it,\\r\\nhowever, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\nLongbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\nthe town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\nBingley.  \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words,\\r\\n\"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\nher no notice of my coming to London.  I was right, therefore,\\r\\nmy last letter had never reached her.  I inquired after their\\r\\nbrother, of course.  He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\nDarcy that they scarcely ever saw him.  I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\nwas expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My visit was\\r\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.  I dare say\\r\\nI shall see them soon here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her that\\r\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She\\r\\nendeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\nshe could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention.  After\\r\\nwaiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\nevery evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\nappear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration\\r\\nof her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\\r\\nThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\r\\nprove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\nher better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\nhave been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me.\\r\\nBut, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do\\r\\nnot think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\nbehaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\\r\\nI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\nwith me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I\\r\\nam sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline did not return my\\r\\nvisit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\nmeantime.  When she did come, it was very evident that she had\\r\\nno pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\nwas in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\naway I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\nlonger.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.  She was very\\r\\nwrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\nadvance to intimacy began on her side.  But I pity her, because\\r\\nshe must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.  I need\\r\\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to\\r\\nbe quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her\\r\\nbehaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister,\\r\\nwhatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\r\\namiable.  I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\nfears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must\\r\\nhave met, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am\\r\\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem,\\r\\nby her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself\\r\\nthat he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If\\r\\nI were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted\\r\\nto say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\\r\\nBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think\\r\\nonly of what will make me happy-- your affection, and the\\r\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from\\r\\nyou very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\r\\nwith any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am\\r\\nextremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our\\r\\nfriends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\r\\nMaria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.-- Yours,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\nshe considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\nat least.  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\nover.  She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\nHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\nhim, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\nhe might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s\\r\\naccount, she would make him abundantly regret what he had\\r\\nthrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\nElizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\nher aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had subsided, his\\r\\nattentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\nElizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\nand write of it without material pain.  Her heart had been but\\r\\nslightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that\\r\\nSHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\\r\\nThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the\\r\\nmost remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now\\r\\nrendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted\\r\\nperhaps in this case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him\\r\\nfor his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the contrary, could\\r\\nbe more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\nstruggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\ndesirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\nthe circumstances, she thus went on:-- \"I am now convinced, my\\r\\ndear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\nexperiences that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\ndetest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.  But my\\r\\nfeelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even\\r\\nimpartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\nall, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\nsort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.  My watchfulness\\r\\nhas been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\nlove with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.  Importance may sometimes be purchased too\\r\\ndearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart\\r\\nthan I do.  They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet\\r\\nopen to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men\\r\\nmust have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\notherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\nsometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February\\r\\npass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had\\r\\nnot at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte,\\r\\nshe soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually\\r\\nlearned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as\\r\\ngreater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\r\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.  There\\r\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\nchange was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey\\r\\nwould moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the\\r\\ntime drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\\r\\nEverything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled\\r\\naccording to Charlotte\\'s first sketch.  She was to accompany Sir\\r\\nWilliam and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending\\r\\na night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\r\\nperfect as plan could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly\\r\\nmiss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\ngoing, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\nanswer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\nfriendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not\\r\\nmake him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to\\r\\ndeserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be\\r\\nadmired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her\\r\\nevery enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--\\r\\ntheir opinion of everybody-- would always coincide, there was a\\r\\nsolicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him\\r\\nwith a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\nthat, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\nthe amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\nthink him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\nMaria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself,\\r\\nhad nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were\\r\\nlistened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\\r\\nElizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too\\r\\nlong.  He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his\\r\\npresentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out,\\r\\nlike his information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\nearly as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.  As they drove to\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window\\r\\nwatching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was\\r\\nthere to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her\\r\\nface, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On the\\r\\nstairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for\\r\\ntheir cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for\\r\\na twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and\\r\\nkindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\nbustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first object was\\r\\nher sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in\\r\\nreply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled\\r\\nto support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.  It was\\r\\nreasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s\\r\\nvisit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations\\r\\noccurring at different times between Jane and herself, which\\r\\nproved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on  Wickham\\'s desertion,\\r\\nand complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss\\r\\nKing?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where\\r\\ndoes discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you\\r\\nwere afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent;\\r\\nand now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\nknow what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s\\r\\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain\\r\\nMY affections because I had no money, what occasion could\\r\\nthere be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about,\\r\\nand who was equally poor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\nelegant decorums which other people may observe.  If SHE does\\r\\nnot object to it, why should WE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM.  It only shows her\\r\\nbeing deficient in something herself-- sense or feeling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose.  HE shall be\\r\\nmercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose.  I should be sorry,\\r\\nyou know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\nDerbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\nlive in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\nHertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all.  Thank\\r\\nHeaven!  I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has\\r\\nnot one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\nrecommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing,\\r\\nafter all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\ndisappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she\\r\\nhad the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her\\r\\nuncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking\\r\\nin the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and\\r\\nher acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight!\\r\\nwhat felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to\\r\\ndisappointment and spleen.  What are young men to rocks and\\r\\nmountains?  Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!  And\\r\\nwhen we DO return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything.  We WILL\\r\\nknow where we have gone-- we WILL recollect what we have\\r\\nseen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together\\r\\nin our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any\\r\\nparticular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative\\r\\nsituation.  Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than\\r\\nthose of the generality of travellers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting\\r\\nto Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\nhad seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\nhealth, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\nsource of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\nwas in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\nbring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\non one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\nhad heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible.  The garden sloping to\\r\\nthe road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel\\r\\nhedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and\\r\\nCharlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the\\r\\nsmall gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst\\r\\nthe nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were\\r\\nall out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs.\\r\\nCollins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\nElizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she\\r\\nfound herself so affectionately received.  She saw instantly that\\r\\nher cousin\\'s manner were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\ncivility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all\\r\\nher family.  They were then, with no other delay than his\\r\\npointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house;\\r\\nand as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a\\r\\nsecond time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode,\\r\\nand punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\nhelp in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\nroom, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\nparticularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\nlost in refusing him.  But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\ncomfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\nrepentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\ncould have so cheerful an air with such a companion.  When\\r\\nMr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\nturned her eye on Charlotte.  Once of twice she could discern a\\r\\nfaint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.  After\\r\\nsitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\nroom, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\ntheir journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\nCollins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\nlarge and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\nattended himself.  To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\nthe exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\nHere, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\nscarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\nfor, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\nbeauty entirely behind.  He could number the fields in every\\r\\ndirection, and could tell how many tress there were in the most\\r\\ndistant clump.  But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared\\r\\nwith the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees\\r\\nthat bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It\\r\\nwas a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\nmeadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\nremains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\naccompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\nhouse, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\nof showing it without her husband\\'s help.  It was rather small,\\r\\nbut well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\narranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth\\r\\ngave Charlotte all the credit.  When Mr. Collins could be\\r\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout,\\r\\nand by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed\\r\\nhe must be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\ncountry.  It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\nMr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I\\r\\nneed not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability\\r\\nand condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured\\r\\nwith some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have\\r\\nscarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my\\r\\nsister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during\\r\\nyour stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\\r\\nWe dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\r\\nwalk home.  Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us.\\r\\nI SHOULD say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has\\r\\nseveral.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\\r\\nadded Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the sort of\\r\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was  spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire\\r\\nnews, and telling again what had already been written; and when\\r\\nit closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\nmeditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\nher address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\nhusband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.  She\\r\\nhad also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\nof their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.  A\\r\\nlively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\nready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the\\r\\nwhole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she\\r\\nheard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling\\r\\nloudly after her.  She opened the door and met Maria in the\\r\\nlanding place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not tell\\r\\nyou what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\nmore, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted\\r\\nthe lane, in quest of this wonder!  It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\nlow phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I expected at least that the\\r\\npigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\nCatherine and her daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is\\r\\nnot Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\nwith them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.  Only look at her.  She\\r\\nis quite a little creature.  Who would have thought that she could\\r\\nbe so thin and small?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this\\r\\nwind.  Why does she not come in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest of\\r\\nfavours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n\"She looks sickly and cross.  Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\nShe will make him a very proper wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high\\r\\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\ncontemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly\\r\\nbowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\nand the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no sooner\\r\\nsaw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their\\r\\ngood fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know\\r\\nthat the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\ncomplete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\nto his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\ntowards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished\\r\\nfor; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon,\\r\\nwas such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension, as he\\r\\nknew not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised\\r\\nby her ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the\\r\\nevening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of\\r\\nher affability, that it would happen.  But who could have\\r\\nforeseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined\\r\\nthat we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,\\r\\nmoreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your\\r\\narrival!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\\r\\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\nreally are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\nuncommon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning\\r\\nbut their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\nthem in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\nso many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\noverpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette. Her said to\\r\\nElizabeth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\\r\\napparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\\r\\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.  I would\\r\\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior\\r\\nto the rest-- there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady\\r\\nCatherine will not think the worse of you for being simply\\r\\ndressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\ndifferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\nliving, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\ncompany, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\nwith as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\npresentation at St. James\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\nmile across the park.  Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\\r\\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the\\r\\nscene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration\\r\\nof the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\nglazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was\\r\\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look\\r\\nperfectly calm.  Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her.  She had\\r\\nheard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any\\r\\nextraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere\\r\\nstateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness\\r\\nwithout trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\nthey followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\nwhere Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\nsitting.  Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\nthem; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the\\r\\noffice of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\nproper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which\\r\\nhe would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s Sir William was so\\r\\ncompletely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had\\r\\nbut just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his\\r\\nseat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost\\r\\nout of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing\\r\\nwhich way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the\\r\\nscene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\\r\\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\r\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome.  Her air was\\r\\nnot conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as\\r\\nto make her visitors forget their inferior rank.  She was not\\r\\nrendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was\\r\\nspoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,\\r\\nand brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and\\r\\nfrom the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady\\r\\nCatherine to be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\ndeportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nshe turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have\\r\\njoined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\\r\\nThere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the\\r\\nladies.  Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though\\r\\nnot plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in\\r\\na low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was\\r\\nnothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to\\r\\nwhat she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\nwindows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\\r\\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them\\r\\nthat it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\nservants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\npromised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\nthe bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if\\r\\nhe felt that life could furnish nothing greater.  He carved, and\\r\\nate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\ncommended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\nenough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\r\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive\\r\\nadmiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any\\r\\ndish on the table proved a novelty to them.  The party did not\\r\\nsupply much conversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak\\r\\nwhenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\r\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh-- the former of whom was\\r\\nengaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a\\r\\nword to her all dinner-time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly\\r\\nemployed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing\\r\\nher to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\\r\\nMaria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen\\r\\ndid nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little\\r\\nto be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did\\r\\nwithout any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\\r\\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that\\r\\nshe was not used to have her judgement controverted.  She\\r\\ninquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and\\r\\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management\\r\\nof them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so\\r\\nsmall a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her\\r\\ncows and her poultry.  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\\r\\nthis great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an\\r\\noccasion of dictating to others.  In the intervals of her discourse\\r\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria\\r\\nand Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections\\r\\nshe knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a\\r\\nvery genteel, pretty kind of girl.  She asked her, at different\\r\\ntimes, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or\\r\\nyounger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be\\r\\nmarried, whether they were handsome, where they had been\\r\\neducated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\r\\nmother\\'s maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\r\\nquestions but answered them very composedly.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nthen observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For\\r\\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I\\r\\nsee no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.  It was\\r\\nnot thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.  Do you\\r\\nplay and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! then-- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\\r\\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---- You\\r\\nshall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of them does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did not you all learn?  You ought all to have learned.  The\\r\\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\nas yours.  Do you draw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity.\\r\\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the\\r\\nbenefit of masters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No governess!  How was that possible? Five daughters brought\\r\\nup at home without a governess!  I never heard of such a thing.\\r\\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\nnot been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a\\r\\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\nas wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always\\r\\nencouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\nI had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\nstrenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\ndone in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\nnobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many\\r\\nfamilies I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am\\r\\nalways glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces\\r\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my\\r\\nmeans; and it was but the other day that I recommended another\\r\\nyoung person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me,\\r\\nand the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I\\r\\ntell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s calling yesterday to thank me?  She\\r\\nfinds Miss Pope a treasure.  \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you\\r\\nhave given me a treasure.\\'  Are any of your younger sisters out,\\r\\nMiss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All!  What, all five out at once?  Very odd!  And you only the\\r\\nsecond.  The younger ones out before the elder ones are\\r\\nmarried!  Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps SHE is full young to\\r\\nbe much in company.  But really, ma\\'am, I think it would be\\r\\nvery hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their\\r\\nshare of society and amusement, because the elder may not have\\r\\nthe means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as\\r\\ngood a right to the pleasures of youth at the first.  And to be\\r\\nkept back on SUCH a motive!  I think it would not be very likely\\r\\nto promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very\\r\\ndecidedly for so young a person.  Pray, what is your age?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\nwho had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\\r\\nimpertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\nnot conceal your age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\ncard-tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nchose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of\\r\\nassisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was\\r\\nsuperlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not\\r\\nrelate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\nfears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\ntoo much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the\\r\\nother table.  Lady Catherine was generally speaking-- stating the\\r\\nmistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\nherself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\nladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\napologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not\\r\\nsay much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\nnames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\\r\\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\\r\\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\ndetermine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\\r\\nFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of\\r\\nthe coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed.\\r\\nAs soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called\\r\\non by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at\\r\\nRosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable\\r\\nthan it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her\\r\\nsome trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was\\r\\nvery soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise into his own\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\nlong enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most\\r\\ncomfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with.  While Sir William\\r\\nwas with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him\\r\\nout in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went\\r\\naway, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\nbreakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in\\r\\nthe garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the\\r\\nwindow in his own book-room, which fronted the road.  The\\r\\nroom in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at\\r\\nfirst rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the\\r\\ndining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and\\r\\nhad a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had\\r\\nan excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would\\r\\nundoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they\\r\\nsat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the\\r\\nlane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of\\r\\nwhat carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de\\r\\nBourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming\\r\\nto inform them of, though it happened almost every day.  She\\r\\nnot unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\r\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there\\r\\nmight be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not\\r\\nunderstand the sacrifice of so many hours.  Now and then they\\r\\nwere honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing\\r\\nescaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\r\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at\\r\\ntheir work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault\\r\\nwith the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid\\r\\nin negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do\\r\\nit only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of\\r\\n\\r\\neat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\nmagistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which\\r\\nwere carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the\\r\\ncottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too\\r\\npoor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\nsilence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and\\r\\nplenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice\\r\\na week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\nonly one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\nthe counterpart of the first.  Their other engagements were few,\\r\\nas the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s reach.  This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth,\\r\\nand upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough;\\r\\nthere were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte,\\r\\nand the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\r\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and\\r\\nwhere she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady\\r\\nCatherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of\\r\\nthe park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one\\r\\nseemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\naway.  Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\\r\\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\ncircle must be important.  Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\narrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\nweeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances\\r\\nwhom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one\\r\\ncomparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she\\r\\nmight be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs\\r\\non him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was\\r\\nevidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming\\r\\nwith the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the\\r\\nhighest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had\\r\\nalready been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas walking the whole morning within view of the lodges\\r\\nopening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest\\r\\n\\r\\nassurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned\\r\\ninto the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.  On the\\r\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\\r\\nThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\r\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the\\r\\nyounger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of\\r\\nall the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman\\r\\naccompanied him.  Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s\\r\\nroom, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other,\\r\\ntold the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nwould never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\ncompliment, before their approach was announced by the\\r\\ndoor-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\\r\\nthe room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about\\r\\nthirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\\r\\ngentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look\\r\\nin Hertfordshire-- paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\nmerely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\npleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\nobservation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\\r\\nsome time without speaking to anybody.  At length, however,\\r\\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after\\r\\nthe health of her family.  She answered him in the usual way,\\r\\nand after a moment\\'s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.  Have\\r\\nyou never happened to see her there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\nsee whether he would betray any consciousness of what had\\r\\npassed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he\\r\\nlooked a little confused as he answered that he had never been\\r\\nso fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.  The subject was pursued\\r\\nno farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\nParsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\nto the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.  It was some\\r\\ndays, however, before they received any invitation thither-- for\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\nnecessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the\\r\\ngentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\nattention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\ncome there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen very\\r\\nlittle of Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\ncalled at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\nDarcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\njoined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room.  Her ladyship\\r\\nreceived them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\nno means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and\\r\\nshe was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to\\r\\nthem, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person\\r\\nin the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything\\r\\nwas a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s\\r\\npretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now\\r\\nseated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\nHertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\nand music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\nin that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\nflow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\nas of Mr. Darcy.  HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\nafter a while, shared the feeling, was more openly\\r\\nacknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are\\r\\ntalking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear\\r\\nwhat it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer\\r\\nable to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my\\r\\n\\r\\ndelight.  I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\nspeaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\nwho have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\nnatural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\nproficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\napply.  I am confident that she would have performed\\r\\ndelightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s\\r\\nproficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\r\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\nexcel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such\\r\\nadvice.  She practises very constantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I\\r\\nnext write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\naccount.  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\nto be acquired without constant practice.  I have told Miss\\r\\nBennet several times, that she will never play really well unless\\r\\nshe practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument,\\r\\nshe is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to\\r\\nRosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\r\\nJenkinson\\'s room.  She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in\\r\\nthat part of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and\\r\\nmade no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth\\r\\nof having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to\\r\\nthe instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nlistened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other\\r\\nnephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with\\r\\nhis usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so\\r\\nas to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance.\\r\\nElizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\npause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\nto hear me?  I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play\\r\\nso well.  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n\\r\\nbe frightened at the will of others.  My courage always rises at\\r\\nevery attempt to intimidate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you\\r\\ncould not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\nyou; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long\\r\\nenough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally\\r\\nprofessing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\nnotion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am\\r\\nparticularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\nmy real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\npass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nit is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\ndisadvantage in Hertfordshire-- and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\nimpolitic too-- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things\\r\\nmay come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam.  \"I should like to know how he behaves\\r\\namong strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall hear then-- but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\ndreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nyou must know, was at a ball-- and at this ball, what do you\\r\\nthink he did?  He danced only four dances, though gentlemen\\r\\nwere scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one\\r\\nyoung lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nyou cannot deny the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\nassembly beyond my own party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.  Well,\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers wait your\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I\\r\\nsought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend\\r\\nmyself to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\nstill addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  \"Shall we ask him why a\\r\\nman of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\nqualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\\r\\napplying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in\\r\\ntheir concerns, as I often see done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument\\r\\nin the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do.  They\\r\\nhave not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the\\r\\nsame expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my\\r\\nown fault-- because I will not take the trouble of practising.  It is\\r\\nnot that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other\\r\\nwoman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right.  You have\\r\\nemployed your time much better.  No one admitted to the\\r\\nprivilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.  We neither\\r\\nof us perform to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\nknow what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\nplaying again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\nfor a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\nand could have the advantage of a London master.  She has a\\r\\nvery good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\nAnne\\'s.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\nhealth allowed her to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\ncould she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of\\r\\nhis behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for\\r\\nMiss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry\\r\\nHER, had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on execution\\r\\nand taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of\\r\\ncivility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the\\r\\ninstrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\nJane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into\\r\\nthe village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the\\r\\ncertain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage, she\\r\\nthought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that\\r\\napprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she\\r\\nmight escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened,\\r\\nand, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,\\r\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised\\r\\nfor his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all\\r\\nthe ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were\\r\\nmade, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was\\r\\nabsolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this\\r\\nemergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him last in\\r\\nHertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say\\r\\non the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.\\r\\nBingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right,\\r\\nhe went but the day before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\nwhen you left London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\nshort pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\never returning to Netherfield again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\nspend very little of his time there in the future.  He has many\\r\\nfriends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are\\r\\ncontinually increasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\r\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for\\r\\nthen we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps,\\r\\nMr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience\\r\\nof the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to\\r\\nkeep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up\\r\\nas soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of\\r\\nhis friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined\\r\\nto leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very\\r\\ncomfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\nit when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe she did-- and I am sure she could not have bestowed\\r\\nher kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\nwife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\none of the very few sensible women who would have accepted\\r\\nhim, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an\\r\\nexcellent understanding-- though I am not certain that I consider\\r\\nher marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She\\r\\nseems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\ncertainly a very good match for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a\\r\\nday\\'s journey.  Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I should never\\r\\nhave said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\\r\\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\\r\\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied\\r\\nshe understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane\\r\\nand Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\nher family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\nmany varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\nexpenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\\r\\nBut that is not the case HERE.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\ncomfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\njourneys-- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\nNEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"YOU\\r\\ncannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  YOU\\r\\ncannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some\\r\\nchange of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper\\r\\nfrom the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued, on either\\r\\nside calm and concise-- and soon put an end to by the entrance\\r\\nof Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.  The\\r\\ntete-a-tete surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\nhad occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\nfew minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone.  \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\nwould never have called us in this familiar way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\\r\\nlikely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\nvarious conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n\\r\\nproceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\nthe more probable from the time of year.  All field sports were\\r\\nover.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\nbilliard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\nin the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\nto it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\ntemptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\nThey called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied\\r\\nby their aunt.  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\ncame because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion\\r\\nwhich of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nreminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by\\r\\nhis evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\nWickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was\\r\\nless captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she\\r\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\ndifficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he\\r\\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\nlips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\nrather than of choice-- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure  to\\r\\nhimself.  He seldom appeared really animated.  Mrs. Collins\\r\\nknew not what to make of him.  Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s\\r\\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\r\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not\\r\\nhave told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\\r\\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend\\r\\nEliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.  She\\r\\nwatched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he\\r\\ncame to Hunsford; but without much success.  He certainly\\r\\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look\\r\\nwas disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\r\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\\r\\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\nhis being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from\\r\\nthe danger of raising expectations which might only end in\\r\\ndisappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt,\\r\\nthat all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose\\r\\nhim to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\nmarrying colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the\\r\\nmost pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in\\r\\nlife was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages,\\r\\nMr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his\\r\\ncousin could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.  She felt all the perverseness of\\r\\nthe mischance that should bring him where no one else was\\r\\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\\r\\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.  How it\\r\\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!  Yet it did,\\r\\nand even a third.  It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\npenance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\ninquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\nthought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.  He never\\r\\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\r\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\r\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--\\r\\nabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary\\r\\nwalks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and\\r\\nthat in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding\\r\\nthe house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into\\r\\nKent again she would be staying THERE too.  His words\\r\\nseemed to imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\nthoughts?  She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean\\r\\nand allusion to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed\\r\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in\\r\\nthe pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing Jane\\'s last\\r\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane\\r\\nhad not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised\\r\\nby Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\nwas meeting her.  Putting away the letter immediately and\\r\\nforcing a smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I\\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the\\r\\nParsonage.  Are you going much farther?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\nParsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his\\r\\ndisposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\nleast pleasure in the great power of choice.  I do not know\\r\\nanybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he\\r\\nlikes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam.  \"But so we all do.  It is only that he has better\\r\\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\\r\\nmany others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you\\r\\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\nof either.  Now seriously, what have you ever known of\\r\\nself-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by\\r\\nwant of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring\\r\\nanything you had a fancy for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are home questions-- and perhaps I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in matters\\r\\nof greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger\\r\\nsons cannot marry where they like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they\\r\\nvery often do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too\\r\\nmany in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\nattention to money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured\\r\\nat the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And\\r\\npray, what is the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son?  Unless\\r\\n\\r\\nthe elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\nabove fifty thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.  To\\r\\ninterrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\nwhat had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for\\r\\nthe sake of  having someone at his disposal.  I wonder he does\\r\\nnot marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,\\r\\nperhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\nunder his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he\\r\\nmust divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship\\r\\nof Miss Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you\\r\\nmake?  Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies\\r\\nof her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she\\r\\nhas the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\nmanner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed\\r\\nMiss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her\\r\\nthat she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She\\r\\ndirectly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her; and\\r\\nI dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\nShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\nacquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have heard\\r\\nyou say that you know them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\nman-- he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care of him!  Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of\\r\\nhim in those points where he most wants care.  From something\\r\\nthat he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think\\r\\nBingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg his\\r\\npardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the\\r\\n\\r\\nperson meant.  It was all conjecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\nknown, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it\\r\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to\\r\\nbe Bingley.  What he told me was merely this: that he\\r\\ncongratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the\\r\\ninconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\\r\\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected\\r\\nit to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get\\r\\ninto a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been\\r\\ntogether the whole of last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\\r\\nagainst the lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling.\\r\\n\"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling\\r\\nwith indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked\\r\\nher why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was he\\r\\nto be the judge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\\r\\npropriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own\\r\\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner\\r\\nhis friend was to be happy.  But,\" she continued, recollecting\\r\\nherself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to\\r\\ncondemn him.  It is not to be supposed that there was much\\r\\n\\r\\naffection in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\r\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer,\\r\\nand therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on\\r\\nindifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.  There, shut\\r\\ninto her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could\\r\\nthink without interruption of all that she had heard.  It was not\\r\\nto be supposed that any other people could be meant than those\\r\\nwith whom she was connected.  There could not exist in the\\r\\nworld TWO men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such\\r\\nboundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the\\r\\nmeasures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never\\r\\ndoubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the\\r\\nprincipal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,\\r\\nhowever,  did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and\\r\\ncaprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still\\r\\ncontinued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every hope of\\r\\nhappiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world;\\r\\nand no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections\\r\\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\\r\\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility\\r\\nof objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-- her\\r\\nunderstanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\ncaptivating.  Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\nwho, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\nprobably never each.\"  When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\nconfidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\nobjections THERE had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\r\\nthe want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from\\r\\ntheir want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he\\r\\nhad been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly\\r\\nby the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\na headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening,\\r\\nthat, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined\\r\\nher not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were\\r\\nengaged to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really\\r\\nunwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible\\r\\nprevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could\\r\\nnot conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather\\r\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\nherself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\nemployment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\nwritten to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no actual\\r\\ncomplaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\ncommunication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost\\r\\nevery line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\nhad been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\nfrom the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\nElizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\nuneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\nfirst perusal.  Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\nbeen able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s\\r\\nsufferings.  It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\nRosings was to end on the day after the next-- and, a still\\r\\ngreater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\nJane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without\\r\\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and\\r\\nagreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\nof the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea\\r\\nof its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before\\r\\ncalled late in the evening, and might now come to inquire\\r\\nparticularly after her.  But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n\\r\\nspirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\namazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.  In an\\r\\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health,\\r\\nimputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.  She\\r\\nanswered him with cold civility.  He sat down for a few\\r\\nmoments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence of\\r\\nseveral minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and\\r\\nthus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain I have struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will not be\\r\\nrepressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\nand love you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,\\r\\ncoloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered sufficient\\r\\nencouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\nfelt for her, immediately followed.  He spoke well; but there\\r\\nwere feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he\\r\\nwas not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of\\r\\npride.  His sense of her inferiority-- of its being a degradation--\\r\\nof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination,\\r\\nwere dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\r\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\\r\\nrecommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible\\r\\nto the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her\\r\\nintentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for\\r\\nthe pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his\\r\\nsubsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.  She\\r\\ntried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience,\\r\\nwhen he should have done.  He concluded with representing to\\r\\nher the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his\\r\\nendeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\r\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\nacceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she could easily see that\\r\\nhe had no doubt of a favourable answer.  He SPOKE of\\r\\napprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\nsecurity.  Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther,\\r\\nand, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that\\r\\nobligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I would\\r\\nnow thank you.  But I cannot-- I have never desired your good\\r\\nopinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.  I\\r\\n\\r\\nam sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.  It has been most\\r\\nunconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short\\r\\nduration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\r\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\r\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his\\r\\neyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\nresentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with\\r\\nanger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every\\r\\nfeature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,\\r\\nand would not open his lips till he believed himself to have\\r\\nattained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful.  At\\r\\nlength, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\nexpecting:  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is of\\r\\nsmall importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \" why with so evident a\\r\\ndesire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\nyou liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\nagainst your character?  Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\nif I WAS uncivil?  But I have other provocations.  You know I\\r\\nhave.  Had not my feelings decided against you-- had they been\\r\\nindifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\nany consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\r\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a\\r\\nmost beloved sister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but\\r\\nthe emotion was short, and he listened without attempting\\r\\nto interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No motive\\r\\ncan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE.\\r\\nYou dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal,\\r\\nif not the only means of dividing them from each other-- of\\r\\nexposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and\\r\\n\\r\\ninstability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes,\\r\\nand involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\nfeeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\naffected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of\\r\\ndenying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\nfrom your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I\\r\\nhave been kinder than towards myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\nreflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\nconciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my\\r\\ndislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\nyou was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital\\r\\nwhich I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this\\r\\nsubject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of\\r\\nfriendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what\\r\\nmisrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\\r\\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his\\r\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.  \"You\\r\\nhave reduced him to his present state of poverty-- comparative\\r\\npoverty.  You have withheld the advantages which you must\\r\\nknow to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the\\r\\nbest years of his life of that independence which was no less his\\r\\ndue than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can\\r\\ntreat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room, \"Is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in\\r\\nwhich you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My\\r\\nfaults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But\\r\\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\\r\\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your\\r\\npride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had\\r\\nlong prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter\\r\\naccusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\r\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief\\r\\nof my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by\\r\\nreason, by reflection, by everything.  But disguise of every sort is\\r\\nmy abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\\r\\nThey were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice in\\r\\nthe inferiority of your connections?-- to congratulate myself on\\r\\nthe hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly\\r\\nbeneath my own?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\ntried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\nyour declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\nthe concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\nbehaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\nway that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with\\r\\nan expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the very beginning-- from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\nsay-- of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me\\r\\nwith the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\nselfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the\\r\\ngroundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\nbuilt so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\nbefore I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\ncould ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend\\r\\nyour feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own\\r\\n\\r\\nhave been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your\\r\\ntime, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\nheard him the next moment open the front door and quit the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.  She knew not\\r\\nhow to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and\\r\\ncried for half-an-hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on\\r\\nwhat had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she\\r\\nshould receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  That he\\r\\nshould have been in love with her for so many months!  So much\\r\\nin love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\r\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and\\r\\nwhich must appear at least with equal force in his own case--\\r\\nwas almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have inspired\\r\\nunconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride, his\\r\\nabominable pride-- his shameless avowal of what he had done\\r\\nwith respect to Jane-- his unpardonable assurance in\\r\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling\\r\\nmanner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty\\r\\ntowards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\\r\\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment\\r\\nexcited.  She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was\\r\\nto encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to\\r\\nher room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\nmeditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not\\r\\nyet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\nimpossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\nemployment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\nherself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\nfavourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes\\r\\ncoming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\nturned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\\r\\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\npassed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\nwas tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\ngates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had now\\r\\npassed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\nevery day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.  She was\\r\\non the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse\\r\\nof a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he\\r\\nwas moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\ndirectly retreating.  But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\nenough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\npronounced her name.  She had turned away; but on hearing\\r\\nherself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that time\\r\\nreached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively\\r\\ntook, said, with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been\\r\\nwalking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.  Will\\r\\nyou do me the honour of reading that letter?\"  And then, with a\\r\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\r\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\r\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper,\\r\\nwritten quite through, in a very close hand.  The envelope itself\\r\\nwas likewise full.  Pursuing her way along the lane, she then\\r\\nbegan it.  It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\nor renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\nyou.  I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\nmyself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\ncannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\nand the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\nspared had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\nYou must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\r\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly,\\r\\nbut I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\nequal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first\\r\\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had\\r\\ndetached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had,\\r\\nin defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n\\r\\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\nprospects of Mr. Wickham.  Wilfully and wantonly to have\\r\\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\r\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\r\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought\\r\\nup to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the\\r\\nseparation of two young persons, whose affection could be the\\r\\ngrowth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.  But\\r\\nfrom the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\\r\\nbestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the\\r\\nfuture secured, when the following account of my actions and\\r\\ntheir motives has been read.  If, in the explanation of them,\\r\\nwhich is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating\\r\\nfeelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I\\r\\nam sorry.  The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology\\r\\nwould be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\nwith others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other\\r\\nyoung woman in the country.  But it was not till the evening of\\r\\nthe dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\nfeeling a serious attachment.  I had often seen him in love before.\\r\\nAt that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was\\r\\nfirst made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental\\r\\ninformation, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\nrise to a general expectation of their marriage.  He spoke of it as\\r\\na certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n>From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively;\\r\\nand I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\nbeyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister I also\\r\\nwatched.  Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and\\r\\nengaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard,\\r\\nand I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that\\r\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not\\r\\ninvite them by any participation of sentiment.  If YOU have not\\r\\nbeen mistaken here, I must have been in error.  Your superior\\r\\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.  If it be\\r\\nso, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your\\r\\nresentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to\\r\\nassert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was\\r\\nsuch as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\r\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\r\\neasily touched.  That I was desirous of believing her indifferent\\r\\nis certain-- but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\ndecisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.  I did\\r\\n\\r\\nnot believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it\\r\\non impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.  My\\r\\nobjections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\nnight acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\\r\\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\\r\\ngreat an evil to my friend as to me.  But there were other causes\\r\\nof repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing\\r\\nto an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured\\r\\nto forget, because they were not immediately before me.  These\\r\\ncauses must be stated, though briefly.  The situation of your\\r\\nmother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\nalmost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\nsisters, and occasionally even by your father.  Pardon me.  It\\r\\npains me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\nof  your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\nthat, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\nthe like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\nyour elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\ndisposition of both.  I will only say farther that from what passed\\r\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\r\\ninducement heightened which could have led me before to\\r\\npreserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\nconnection.  He left Netherfield for London, on the day\\r\\nfollowing, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of\\r\\nsoon returning.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained.  His sisters\\'\\r\\nuneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\\r\\ncoincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible\\r\\nthat no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\\r\\nresolved on joining him directly in London.  We accordingly\\r\\nwent-- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out\\r\\nto my friend the certain evils of such a choice.  I described, and\\r\\nenforced them earnestly.  But, however this remonstrance might\\r\\nhave staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\r\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not\\r\\nbeen seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of\\r\\nyour sister\\'s indifference.  He had before believed her to return\\r\\nhis affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.  But Bingley\\r\\nhas great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\\r\\njudgement than on his own.  To convince him, therefore, that he\\r\\nhad deceived himself, was no very difficult point.  To persuade\\r\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.  I cannot\\r\\nblame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part\\r\\nof my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with\\r\\nsatisfaction; it is, that I condescended to adopt the measures of\\r\\nart so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town.  I\\r\\nknew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother\\r\\nis even yet ignorant of it.  That they might have met without ill\\r\\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear\\r\\nto me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\r\\ndanger.  Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me;\\r\\nit is done, however, and it was done for the best.  On this subject\\r\\nI have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.  If I have\\r\\nwounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and\\r\\nthough the motives which governed me may to you very\\r\\nnaturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\ninjured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\nthe whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has\\r\\nPARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of\\r\\nwhat I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of\\r\\nundoubted veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\nmany years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and\\r\\nwhose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally\\r\\ninclined my father to be of service to him; and on George\\r\\nWickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore\\r\\nliberally bestowed.  My father supported him at school, and\\r\\nafterwards at Cambridge-- most important assistance, as his own\\r\\nfather, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would\\r\\nhave been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education.  My\\r\\nfather was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose\\r\\nmanner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of\\r\\nhim, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to\\r\\nprovide for him in it.  As for myself, it is many, many years since\\r\\nI first began to think of him in a very different manner.  The\\r\\nvicious propensities-- the want of principle, which he was careful\\r\\nto guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\r\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with\\r\\nhimself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded\\r\\nmoments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again shall\\r\\ngive you pain-- to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever\\r\\nmay be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\nreal character-- it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\nattachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\nwill he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\nallow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\r\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant.  There was also a\\r\\nlegacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father did not long\\r\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\nWickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved\\r\\nagainst taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\\r\\nunreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\\r\\nadvantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\r\\nbenefited.  He had some intention, he added, of studying law,\\r\\nand I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be a very insufficient support therein.  I rather wished,\\r\\nthan believed him to be sincere-- but, at any rate, was perfectly\\r\\nready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon\\r\\nsettled-- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it\\r\\npossible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and\\r\\naccepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection\\r\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved.  I thought too ill of him to\\r\\ninvite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town I\\r\\nbelieve he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere\\r\\npretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life\\r\\nof idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of\\r\\nhim; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had\\r\\nbeen designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the\\r\\npresentation.  His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found\\r\\nthe law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\r\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living\\r\\nin question-- of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as\\r\\nhe was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\r\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions.\\r\\nYou will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this\\r\\nentreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.  His resentment\\r\\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances-- and he\\r\\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\nreproaches to myself.  After this period every appearance of\\r\\nacquaintance was dropped.  How he lived I know not.  But last\\r\\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to\\r\\nforget myself, and which no obligation less than the present\\r\\nshould induce me to unfold to any human being.  Having said\\r\\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is\\r\\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of\\r\\nmy mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a\\r\\nyear ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\\r\\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\\r\\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went\\r\\nMr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have\\r\\nbeen a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in\\r\\nwhose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her\\r\\nconnivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to\\r\\nGeorgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression\\r\\nof his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to\\r\\nbelieve herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.  She was\\r\\nthen but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\r\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it\\r\\nto herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\\r\\nintended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\r\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost\\r\\nlooked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You\\r\\nmay imagine what I felt and how I acted.  Regard for my sister\\'s\\r\\ncredit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to\\r\\nMr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge\\r\\nwas of course removed from her charge.  Mr. Wickham\\'s object\\r\\nwas unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand\\r\\npounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\r\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement.  His revenge would\\r\\nhave been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\nhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\r\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of\\r\\ncruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner,\\r\\nunder what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his\\r\\nsuccess is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you\\r\\npreviously were of everything concerning either.  Detection\\r\\ncould not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\nnight; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\ncould or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of everything here\\r\\n\\r\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and\\r\\nconstant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my\\r\\nfather\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every\\r\\nparticular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of ME\\r\\nshould make MY assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\\r\\nby the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there\\r\\nmay be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to\\r\\nfind some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\r\\ncourse of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you,\\r\\n                                   \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\nit to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\nexpectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it may\\r\\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what\\r\\na contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read\\r\\nwere scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she first\\r\\nunderstand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\nsteadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.  With a\\r\\nstrong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\naccount of what had happened at Netherfield.  She read with an\\r\\neagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and\\r\\nfrom impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring,\\r\\nwas incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her\\r\\neyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\nto be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\nthe match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\njustice.  He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\nsatisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all\\r\\npride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\nWickham-- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\\r\\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished\\r\\nopinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to\\r\\nhis own history of himself-- her feelings were yet more acutely\\r\\npainful and more difficult of definition.  Astonishment,\\r\\napprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.  She wished to\\r\\ndiscredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cannot be!  This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-- and\\r\\nwhen she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely\\r\\nknowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,\\r\\nprotesting that she would not regard it, that she would never\\r\\nlook in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\nletter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\ncould, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\nto Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\nmeaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with\\r\\nthe Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself;\\r\\nand the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not\\r\\nbefore known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\r\\nwords.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she\\r\\ncame to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had\\r\\nsaid of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled\\r\\nhis very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross\\r\\nduplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she\\r\\nflattered herself that her wishes did not err.  But when she read\\r\\nand re-read with the closest attention, the particulars\\r\\nimmediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to\\r\\nthe living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\r\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.  She put\\r\\ndown the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she\\r\\nmeant to be impartiality-- deliberated on the probability of each\\r\\nstatement-- but with little success.  On both sides it was only\\r\\nassertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly\\r\\nthat the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any\\r\\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct\\r\\nin it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make\\r\\nhim entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not\\r\\nto lay at Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the\\r\\nmore so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had\\r\\nnever heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia,\\r\\nin which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man\\r\\nwho, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a\\r\\nslight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been\\r\\nknown in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.  As to his real\\r\\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never felt\\r\\na wish of inquiring.  His countenance, voice, and manner had\\r\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue.  She\\r\\n\\r\\ntried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\r\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\r\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue,\\r\\natone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour\\r\\nto class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of\\r\\nmany years\\' continuance.  But no such recollection befriended\\r\\nher.  She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of\\r\\nair and address; but she could remember no more substantial\\r\\ngood than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\\r\\nAfter pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more\\r\\ncontinued to read.  But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\r\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what\\r\\nhad passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\\r\\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\\r\\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself-- from whom she\\r\\nhad previously received the information of his near concern in all\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to\\r\\nquestion.  At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\r\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the\\r\\napplication, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\r\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had\\r\\nnot been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\nat Mr. Phillips\\'s.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her\\r\\nmemory.  She was NOW struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\ncommunications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\nbefore.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\nhad done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\nconduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\r\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy-- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,\\r\\nbut that HE should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the\\r\\nNetherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also that,\\r\\ntill the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his\\r\\nstory to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had\\r\\nbeen everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no\\r\\nscruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured\\r\\nher that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing\\r\\nthe son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\nconcerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the\\r\\nconsequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the\\r\\n\\r\\nmediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his\\r\\nwishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.  His behaviour to\\r\\nherself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either\\r\\nbeen deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\r\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she\\r\\nhad most incautiously shown.  Every lingering struggle in his\\r\\nfavour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by\\r\\nJane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that\\r\\nproud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the\\r\\nwhole course of their acquaintance-- an acquaintance which\\r\\nhad latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\nintimacy with his ways-- seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\nunprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\nimmoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\r\\nesteemed and valued-- that even Wickham had allowed him\\r\\nmerit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so\\r\\naffectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some\\r\\namiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham\\r\\nrepresented them, so gross a violation of everything right could\\r\\nhardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship\\r\\nbetween a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as\\r\\nBingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.  Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\nWickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\npartial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided\\r\\nmyself on my discernment!  I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\nabilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\nsister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\nHow humiliating is this discovery!  yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\nHad I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\nBut vanity, not love, has been my folly.  Pleased with the\\r\\npreference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\nthe very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where\\r\\neither were concerned.  Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n>From herself to Jane-- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were\\r\\nin a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nexplanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\nit again.  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\nHow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich she had been obliged to give in the other?  He declared\\r\\nhimself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment; and\\r\\nshe could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had\\r\\nalways been.  Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\ndescription of Jane.  She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent,\\r\\nwere little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency\\r\\nin her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\nsense of shame was severe.  The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\ntoo forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\nparticularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and\\r\\nas confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a\\r\\nstronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.  It\\r\\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\nthus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\nconsidered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\nof her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\nof both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\ndepressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to\\r\\nevery variety of thought--re-considering events, determining\\r\\nprobabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a\\r\\nchange so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\nof her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\nentered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\nand the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\nher unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings\\r\\nhad each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\nminutes, to take leave-- but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\nsitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\nalmost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\nElizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing him; she\\r\\nreally rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\nobject; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.\\r\\nCollins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his\\r\\nparting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\\r\\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\\r\\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene\\r\\nso lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened,\\r\\nto console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\r\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her\\r\\nladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her\\r\\nvery desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\nhad she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\nher as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\nwhat her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been.  \"What would\\r\\nshe have said? how would she have behaved?\" were questions\\r\\nwith which she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.  \"I\\r\\nassure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe\\r\\nno one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.  But I am\\r\\nparticularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\nso much attached to me!  They were excessively sorry to go!\\r\\nBut so they always are.  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\\r\\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\nmore, I think, than last year.  His attachment to Rosings\\r\\ncertainly increases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\nwhich were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\nout of spirits. And immediately accounting for it by herself, by\\r\\nsupposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\nthat you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\nof your company, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\"\\r\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.  I must\\r\\nbe in town next Saturday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I\\r\\nexpected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\nyou came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my father cannot.  He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father.  And if\\r\\nyou will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power\\r\\nto take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\nJune, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\nbarouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--\\r\\nand indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\nobject to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by\\r\\nour original plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.  \"Mrs. Collins, you must send\\r\\na servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I\\r\\ncannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by\\r\\nthemselves.  It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send\\r\\nsomebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\\r\\nthing.  Young women should always be properly guarded and\\r\\nattended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece\\r\\nGeorgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\r\\nhaving two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have\\r\\nappeared with propriety in a different manner.  I am excessively\\r\\nattentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young\\r\\nladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;\\r\\nfor it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Your uncle!  He keeps a man-servant, does he?  I am very\\r\\nglad you have somebody who thinks of these things.  Where\\r\\nshall you change horses?  Oh!  Bromley, of course.  If you\\r\\nmention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\njourney, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was\\r\\nnecessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with\\r\\n\\r\\na mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she\\r\\nwas alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\nwent by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all\\r\\nthe delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\nheart.  She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\nwriter were at times widely different.  When she remembered the\\r\\nstyle of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she\\r\\nconsidered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\nher anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\nfeelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment\\r\\nexcited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could\\r\\nnot approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\r\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In her\\r\\nown past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation\\r\\nand regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a constant\\r\\nsource of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her\\r\\nfamily, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of\\r\\nremedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at them, would\\r\\nnever exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest\\r\\ndaughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\r\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nfrequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the\\r\\nimprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were\\r\\nsupported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there\\r\\nbe of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and\\r\\ncompletely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted\\r\\nby their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\r\\nscarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and vain.\\r\\nWhile there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;\\r\\nand while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would\\r\\nbe going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former\\r\\ngood opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His\\r\\naffection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\ncleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\nof his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the\\r\\nthought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\nreplete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\r\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\nweek of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening\\r\\nwas spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into\\r\\nthe particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\nbest method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\nplacing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\nobliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\npack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\nwished them a good journey, and invited them to come to\\r\\nHunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so\\r\\nfar as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for\\r\\nbreakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took\\r\\nthe opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\nindispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\nyet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\nam very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\nher thanks for it.  The favor of your company has been much\\r\\nfelt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to tempt any one\\r\\nto our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small\\r\\nrooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world,\\r\\nmust make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\r\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the\\r\\ncondescension, and that we have done everything in our power\\r\\nto prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of\\r\\nhappiness.  She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and\\r\\nthe pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she\\r\\nhad received, must make HER feel the obliged.  Mr. Collins was\\r\\ngratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\ntime not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best; and\\r\\nmost fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to  very\\r\\nsuperior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n\\r\\nfrequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we\\r\\nmay flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\nentirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nfamily is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\nwhich few can boast.  You see on what a footing we are.  You\\r\\nsee how continually we are engaged there.  In truth I must\\r\\nacknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\\r\\nparsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\r\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\nwas obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\nunite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\nwill be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it\\r\\ndoes not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate----\\r\\nBut on this point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me\\r\\nassure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\\r\\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My dear\\r\\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\\r\\nThere is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\r\\ncharacter and ideas between us.  We seem to have been designed\\r\\nfor each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\nthat was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\nfirmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was\\r\\nnot sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the\\r\\nlady from whom they sprang.  Poor Charlotte!  it was\\r\\nmelancholy to leave her to such society!  But she had chosen it\\r\\nwith her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her\\r\\nvisitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\\r\\nHer home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and\\r\\nall their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\nparcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.  After\\r\\nan affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\nattended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked\\r\\ndown the garden he was commissioning her with his best\\r\\nrespects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\\r\\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\r\\n\\r\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He\\r\\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\\r\\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\\r\\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any\\r\\nmessage for the ladies at Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\nrespects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\nkindness to you while you have been here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\nshut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it\\r\\nseems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\nthings have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\ntwice!  How much I shall have to tell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to\\r\\nconceal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\nalarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\nreached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\nstudying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\nkindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go\\r\\nhome with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough\\r\\nfor observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait\\r\\neven for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nproposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what\\r\\nwould so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time,\\r\\nso highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet\\r\\nbeen able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as\\r\\nnothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in\\r\\nwhich she remained as to the extent of what she should\\r\\ncommunicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might\\r\\nonly grieve her sister further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\nset out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in\\r\\nHertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived,\\r\\nin token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia\\r\\nlooking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been\\r\\nabove an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an\\r\\nopposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a\\r\\nsalad and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table\\r\\nset out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"Is not this nice?  Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must\\r\\nlend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out\\r\\nthere.\"  Then, showing her purchases-- \"Look here, I have\\r\\nbought this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought\\r\\nI might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I\\r\\nget home, and see if I can not make it up any better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\nshop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to\\r\\ntrim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.  Besides, it will\\r\\nnot much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire\\r\\nhave left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\\r\\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such\\r\\na delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\nall.  Mamma would like to go too of all things!  Only think what\\r\\na miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful scheme\\r\\nindeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!\\r\\nBrighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been\\r\\n\\r\\noverset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly\\r\\nballs of Meryton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat\\r\\ndown at table.  \"What do you think?  It is excellent news--\\r\\ncapital news-- and about a certain person we all like!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\nhe need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.  You\\r\\nthought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he\\r\\noften hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is\\r\\nan ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long\\r\\nchin in my life.  Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\nWickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?  There is no danger\\r\\nof Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King.  There\\'s for you!  She is\\r\\ngone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.  Wickham is\\r\\nsafe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\\r\\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said\\r\\nJane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure there is not on HIS.  I will answer for it, he never\\r\\ncared three straws about her-- who could about such a nasty\\r\\nlittle freckled thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\ncoarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\nSENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\\r\\nharboured and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\ntheir boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\nof Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia.  \"I am glad I\\r\\nbought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\nbandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and\\r\\n\\r\\ntalk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let us\\r\\nhear what has happened to you all since you went away.  Have\\r\\nyou seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?  I was in\\r\\ngreat hopes that one of you would have got a husband before\\r\\nyou came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\r\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty!  My aunt Phillips wants you so\\r\\nto get husbands, you can\\'t think.  She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\ntaken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been\\r\\nany fun in it.  Lord! how I should like to be married before any\\r\\nof you!  and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\r\\nDear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at\\r\\nColonel Forster\\'s.  Kitty and me were to spend the day there,\\r\\nand Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening;\\r\\n(by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\\r\\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so\\r\\nPen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think\\r\\nwe did?  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on\\r\\npurpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!  Not a soul\\r\\nknew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me,\\r\\nexcept my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her\\r\\ngowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!  When\\r\\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\\r\\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least.  Lord!  how I\\r\\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster.  I thought I should have died.\\r\\nAnd THAT made the men suspect something, and then they\\r\\nsoon found out what was the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\namuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlistened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the\\r\\nfrequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\nsee Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during\\r\\ndinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\\r\\nwere the subjects that occupied them:  Lady Lucas was inquiring\\r\\nof Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter;\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an\\r\\naccount of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way\\r\\n\\r\\nbelow her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\r\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other\\r\\nperson\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning\\r\\nto anybody who would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\nsuch fun!  As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\npretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have\\r\\ngone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got\\r\\nto the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we\\r\\ntreated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the\\r\\nworld, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you\\r\\ntoo.  And then when we came away it was such fun!  I thought\\r\\nwe never should have got into the coach.  I was ready to die of\\r\\nlaughter.  And then we were so merry all the way home!  we\\r\\ntalked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us\\r\\nten miles off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear\\r\\nsister, to depreciate such pleasures!  They would doubtless be\\r\\ncongenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess\\r\\nthey would have no charms for ME-- I should infinitely prefer a\\r\\nbook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened\\r\\nto anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to\\r\\nMary at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\nwalk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\\r\\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said\\r\\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before\\r\\nthey were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason\\r\\ntoo for her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again,\\r\\nand was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to\\r\\nHER of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond\\r\\nexpression.  In a fortnight they were to go-- and once gone, she\\r\\nhoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\nBrighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the\\r\\ninn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\\r\\nElizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest\\r\\nintention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so\\r\\nvague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\r\\n\\r\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\ncould no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to\\r\\nsuppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and\\r\\npreparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next\\r\\nmorning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\nsisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\nperfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\nfeelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\nsentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\nstill more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s\\r\\nrefusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and\\r\\ncertainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\nmust increase his disappointment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\nhas other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\nregard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing\\r\\nhim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blame you!  Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\nnext day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\nas far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a stroke was\\r\\nthis for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the\\r\\nworld without believing that so much wickedness existed in the\\r\\nwhole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\\r\\nNor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings,\\r\\n\\r\\ncapable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did\\r\\nshe labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the\\r\\none without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to\\r\\nmake both of them good for anything.  Take your choice, but\\r\\nyou must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such a quantity\\r\\nof merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of\\r\\nman; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my\\r\\npart, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s; but you shall do as\\r\\nyou choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted\\r\\nfrom Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\\r\\nSuch a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill\\r\\nopinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister!  It is\\r\\nreally too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing\\r\\nyou so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample justice,\\r\\nthat I am growing every moment more unconcerned and\\r\\nindifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament\\r\\nover him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the\\r\\neducation of those two young men.  One has got all the\\r\\ngoodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE\\r\\nof it as you used to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided\\r\\na dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one\\'s\\r\\ngenius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\nOne may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\none cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\nstumbling on something witty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\ntreat the matter as you do now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\nunhappy.  And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no\\r\\nJane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\\r\\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!  Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\nexpressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\nDO appear wholly undeserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\nmost natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\nencouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice.  I\\r\\nwant to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\nacquaintances in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can\\r\\nbe no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your\\r\\nopinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not\\r\\nauthorised me to make his communication public.  On the\\r\\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\\r\\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to\\r\\nundeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe\\r\\nme?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that\\r\\nit would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to\\r\\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.\\r\\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\r\\nanyone here what he really is.  Some time hence it will be all\\r\\nfound out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not\\r\\nknowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\nhim for ever.  He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done,\\r\\nand anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him\\r\\ndesperate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\nShe had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\nfor a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\nwhenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was\\r\\nstill something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nletter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\nvalued by her friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one\\r\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a\\r\\nperfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\r\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.  \"And then,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall\\r\\nmerely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more\\r\\nagreeable manner himself.  The liberty of communication cannot\\r\\nbe mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\nreal state of her sister\\'s spirits.  Jane was not happy.  She still\\r\\ncherished a very tender affection for Bingley.  Having never even\\r\\nfancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\nfirst attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\nsteadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\nfervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\nother man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of\\r\\nthose regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\nand their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion\\r\\nNOW of this sad business of Jane\\'s?  For my part, I am\\r\\ndetermined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told my\\r\\nsister Phillips so the other day.  But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\nsaw anything of him in London.  Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\nyoung man-- and I do not suppose there\\'s the least chance in the\\r\\nworld of her ever getting him now.  There is no talk of his\\r\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired\\r\\nof everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\nif I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort\\r\\nis, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be\\r\\nsorry for what he has done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\nexpectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Collinses live very comfortable, do they?  Well, well, I only\\r\\nhope it will last.  And what sort of table do they keep?  Charlotte\\r\\nis an excellent manager, I dare say.  If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\nmother, she is saving enough.  There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\nTHEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  Yes, yes.\\r\\nTHEY will take care not to outrun their income.  THEY will\\r\\nnever be distressed for money.  Well, much good may it do\\r\\nthem!  And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  They look upon it as quite their own,\\r\\nI dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\\r\\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves.  Well, if they can\\r\\nbe easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\nbetter.  I should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\nentailed on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\nIt was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\nyoung ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.  The\\r\\ndejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets alone\\r\\nwere still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual\\r\\ncourse of their employments.  Very frequently were they\\r\\nreproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own\\r\\nmisery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\r\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us?  What are we to do?\"\\r\\nwould they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe.  \"How can\\r\\nyou be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\nwhat she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty\\r\\nyears ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\\r\\nColonel Miller\\'s regiment went away.  I thought I should have\\r\\nbroken my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!-- if one could but go to Brighton!  But papa is so\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of\\r\\ngood,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\\r\\nthrough Longbourn House.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\\r\\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt anew\\r\\nthe justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she been so\\r\\nmuch disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\nshe received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\ncolonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.  This\\r\\ninvaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\nmarried.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\nrecommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their\\r\\nTHREE months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate TWO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\nForster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\nKitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\nsister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy,\\r\\ncalling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking\\r\\nwith more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued\\r\\nin the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her\\r\\naccent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as\\r\\nLydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend.  I\\r\\nhave just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\nI am two years older.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane\\r\\nto make her resigned.  As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation\\r\\nwas so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\nand Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\npossibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such\\r\\na step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly\\r\\nadvising her father not to let her go.  She represented to him all\\r\\nthe improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little\\r\\nadvantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman\\r\\nas Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\ntemptations must be greater than at home.  He heard her\\r\\nattentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\npublic place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\nso little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\npresent circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\\r\\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\nLydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner-- nay, which has\\r\\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in\\r\\nthe affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet.  \"What, has she\\r\\nfrightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little Lizzy!  But do\\r\\nnot be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be\\r\\nconnected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come,\\r\\nlet me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by\\r\\nLydia\\'s folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent.  It is\\r\\nnot of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\ncomplaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world\\r\\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain\\r\\nof all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character.  Excuse me, for I\\r\\nmust speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the\\r\\ntrouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her\\r\\nthat her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she\\r\\nwill soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her character will\\r\\nbe fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\r\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction\\r\\nbeyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance\\r\\n\\r\\nand emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any\\r\\nportion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration\\r\\nwill excite.  In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.  She will\\r\\nfollow wherever Lydia leads.  Vain, ignorant, idle, and\\r\\nabsolutely uncontrolled!  Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it\\r\\npossible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\r\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved\\r\\nin the disgrace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane\\r\\nare known you must be respected and valued; and you will not\\r\\nappear to less advantage for having a couple of-- or I may say,\\r\\nthree-- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if\\r\\nLydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go, then.  Colonel\\r\\nForster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real\\r\\nmischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to\\r\\nanybody.  At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a\\r\\ncommon flirt than she has been here.  The officers will find\\r\\nwomen better worth their notice.  Let us hope, therefore, that\\r\\nher being there may teach her her own insignificance.  At any\\r\\nrate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising\\r\\nus to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her\\r\\nown opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed\\r\\nand sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\nvexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having\\r\\nperformed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\naugment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her\\r\\nconference with her father, their indignation would hardly have\\r\\nfound expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia\\'s\\r\\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised ever possibility of\\r\\nearthly happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the\\r\\nstreets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.  She saw\\r\\nherself  the object to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\nunknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp-- its tents\\r\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with\\r\\nthe young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to\\r\\ncomplete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent,\\r\\ntenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\nand such realities as these, what would have been her\\r\\nsensations?  They could have been understood only by her\\r\\nmother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia\\'s going to\\r\\nBrighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction\\r\\nof her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\nraptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\nLydia\\'s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\\r\\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return,\\r\\nagitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality\\r\\nentirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness\\r\\nwhich had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to\\r\\ndisgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to herself,\\r\\nmoreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\ninclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\nafter what had since passed, to provoke her.  She lost all concern\\r\\nfor him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle\\r\\nand frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could\\r\\nnot but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however\\r\\nlong, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn,\\r\\nher vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any\\r\\ntime by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\ndined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was\\r\\nElizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his\\r\\nmaking some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\npassed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and\\r\\nasked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s\\r\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\nseen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.  Her\\r\\nanswer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference he\\r\\nsoon afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very different.  But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape\\r\\nher.  \"And pray, may I ask?-- \"  But checking himself, he added,\\r\\nin a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves?  Has he\\r\\ndeigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?-- for I dare\\r\\nnot hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that\\r\\nhe is improved in essentials.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth.  \"In essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\nmuch what he ever was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\\r\\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\\r\\nThere was a something in her countenance which made him\\r\\nlisten with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\nthat his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\nthat, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\nunderstood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\nagitated look; for a few minuted he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\nhis embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\ngentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will\\r\\nreadily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise\\r\\nenough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right.\\r\\nHis pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself,\\r\\nto many others, for it must only deter him from such foul\\r\\nmisconduct as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of\\r\\ncautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\r\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nand judgement he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has\\r\\nalways operated, I know, when they were together; and a good\\r\\ndeal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with\\r\\nMiss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only\\r\\nby a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he wanted to\\r\\nengage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in\\r\\nno humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\nthe APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with\\r\\nno further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at\\r\\nlast with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\nmeeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\nMeryton, from whence they were to set out early the next\\r\\nmorning.  The separation between her and her family was rather\\r\\nnoisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but\\r\\nshe did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was diffuse\\r\\nin her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and\\r\\nimpressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\r\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible-- advice\\r\\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well attended\\r\\nto; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding\\r\\nfarewell, the more gentle adieux of her sisters were uttered\\r\\nwithout being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\ncould not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\nfelicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth\\r\\nand beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth\\r\\nand beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak\\r\\nunderstanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage\\r\\nput and end to all real affection for her.  Respect, esteem, and\\r\\nconfidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic\\r\\nhappiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\r\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his\\r\\nown imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which\\r\\ntoo often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.  He\\r\\nwas fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had\\r\\narisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife he was very little\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had\\r\\ncontributed to his amusement.  This is not the sort of happiness\\r\\nwhich a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but\\r\\nwhere other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\r\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\nher father\\'s behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it with\\r\\npain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate\\r\\ntreatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could\\r\\nnot overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual\\r\\nbreach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing\\r\\nhis wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly\\r\\nreprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as now the\\r\\ndisadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a\\r\\nmarriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from\\r\\nso ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\r\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\\r\\neven if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she\\r\\nfound little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\\r\\nregiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and\\r\\nat home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at\\r\\nthe dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over\\r\\ntheir domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\nnatural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\nremoved, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\nmight be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\nand assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\nwatering-place and a camp.  Upon the whole, therefore, she\\r\\nfound, what has been sometimes been found before, that an\\r\\nevent to which she had been looking with impatient desire did\\r\\nnot, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised\\r\\nherself.  It was consequently necessary to name some other\\r\\nperiod for the commencement of actual felicity-- to have some\\r\\nother point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and\\r\\nby again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for\\r\\nthe present, and prepare for another disappointment.  Her tour\\r\\nto the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was\\r\\nher best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\\r\\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and\\r\\ncould she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\\r\\nwould have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish\\r\\nfor.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\nwould be certain.  But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\nsource of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\nhave all my expectations of pleasure realised.  A scheme of\\r\\nwhich every part promises delight can never be successful; and\\r\\ngeneral disappointment is only warded off by the defence of\\r\\nsome little peculiar vexation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and\\r\\nvery minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were\\r\\nalways long expected, and always very short.  Those to her\\r\\nmother contained little else than that they were just returned\\r\\nfrom the library, where such and such officers had attended\\r\\nthem, and where she had seen such beautiful  ornaments as made\\r\\nher quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\r\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave\\r\\noff in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were\\r\\ngoing off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her\\r\\nsister,  there was still less to be learnt-- for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\nthough rather longer, were much too full of lines under the\\r\\nwords to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\ngood humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\nEverything wore a happier aspect.  The families who had been in\\r\\ntown for the winter came back again, and summer finery and\\r\\nsummer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored to her\\r\\nusual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was\\r\\nso much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;\\r\\nan event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that\\r\\nby the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable\\r\\nas not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some\\r\\ncruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another\\r\\nregiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\nfast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\nletter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\ncommencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\nprevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\nJuly, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\nleft too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much\\r\\nas they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\ncomfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n\\r\\nLakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\nthe present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\nDerbyshire.  In that county there was enough to be seen to\\r\\noccupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it\\r\\nhad a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had\\r\\nformerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now\\r\\nto spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her\\r\\ncuriosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\r\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\nseeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\nenough.  But it was her business to be satisfied-- and certainly\\r\\nher temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas\\r\\nconnected.  It was impossible for her to see the word without\\r\\nthinking of Pemberley and its owner.  \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\\r\\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\\r\\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.  Four weeks were\\r\\nto pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival.  But they did\\r\\npass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children,\\r\\ndid at length appear at Longbourn.  The children, two girls of six\\r\\nand eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under\\r\\nthe particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\nfavourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper\\r\\nexactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--\\r\\nteaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off\\r\\nthe next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and\\r\\namusement.  One enjoyment was certain-- that of suitableness of\\r\\ncompanions; a suitableness which comprehended health and\\r\\ntemper to bear inconveniences-- cheerfulness to enhance every\\r\\npleasure-- and affection and intelligence, which might supply it\\r\\namong themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\ntheir route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\nBirmingham, &c., are sufficiently known.  A small part of\\r\\nDerbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of\\r\\nLambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained,\\r\\nthey bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders\\r\\nof the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth\\r\\nfound from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.  It was not in\\r\\ntheir direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.  In\\r\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\nexpressed an inclination to see the place again.  Mr. Gardiner\\r\\ndeclared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her\\r\\napprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\nheard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so\\r\\nmany of your acquaintances are connected.  Wickham passed all\\r\\nhis youth there, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was distressed.  She felt that she had no business at\\r\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\nit.  She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\ngoing over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\nsatin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  If it were merely a fine\\r\\nhouse richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it\\r\\nmyself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the\\r\\nfinest woods in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said no more-- but her mind could not acquiesce.  The\\r\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\ninstantly occurred.  It would be dreadful!  She blushed at the\\r\\nvery idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her\\r\\naunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were\\r\\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\\r\\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\\r\\nwere unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\\r\\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\\r\\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,\\r\\nwhether the family were down for the summer?  A most\\r\\nwelcome negative followed the last question-- and her alarms\\r\\nnow being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\r\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\\r\\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could\\r\\nreadily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had\\r\\nnot really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore,\\r\\nthey were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\nof Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at\\r\\nlength they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high\\r\\nflutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\ntime through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\nadmired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They\\r\\ngradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\\r\\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\\r\\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated\\r\\non the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some\\r\\nabruptness wound.  It was a large, handsome stone building,\\r\\nstanding well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\r\\nwoody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance\\r\\nwas swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\\r\\nIts banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwas delighted.  She had never seen a place for which nature had\\r\\ndone more, or where natural beauty had been so little\\r\\ncounteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all of them warm\\r\\nin their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be\\r\\nmistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\ndoor; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\nher apprehension of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded\\r\\nlest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see\\r\\nthe place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as\\r\\nthey waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her\\r\\nbeing where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,\\r\\nmuch less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of\\r\\nfinding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It was\\r\\na large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\\r\\nElizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy\\r\\nits prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, which they had\\r\\ndescended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\r\\nwas a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the ground was\\r\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees\\r\\nscattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as\\r\\nshe could trace it, with delight.  As they passed into other\\r\\nrooms these objects were taking different positions; but from\\r\\nevery window there were beauties to be seen.  The rooms were\\r\\nlofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune\\r\\nof its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste,\\r\\nthat it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\r\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress!\\r\\nWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\nInstead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\nthem as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle\\r\\nand aunt.  But no,\" recollecting herself-- \"that could never be;\\r\\nmy uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not\\r\\nhave been allowed to invite them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lucky recollection-- it saved her from something\\r\\nvery like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master\\r\\nwas really absent, but had not the courage for it.  At length\\r\\nhowever, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned\\r\\naway with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was,\\r\\nadding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of\\r\\nfriends.\"  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey\\r\\nhad not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached\\r\\nand saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst\\r\\nseveral other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.  Her aunt asked\\r\\nher, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward,\\r\\nand told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of\\r\\nher late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at\\r\\nhis own expense.  \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\r\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\nminiatures, \"is my master-- and very like him.  It was drawn at\\r\\nthe same time as the other-- about eight years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.  But,\\r\\nLizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery\\r\\nupstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\nThis room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these\\r\\nminiatures are just as they used to be then.  He was very fond\\r\\nof them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\\r\\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight\\r\\nyears old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and\\r\\nso accomplished!-- She plays and sings all day long.  In the next\\r\\nroom is a new instrument just come down for her-- a present\\r\\nfrom my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\nencouraged her communicativeness by his questions and\\r\\nremarks:  Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\\r\\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\nhalf his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the\\r\\nsummer months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be.  I do not\\r\\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n\"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\\r\\nknows him,\" replied the other.  Elizabeth thought this was\\r\\ngoing pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment\\r\\nas the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\\r\\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\\r\\nfour years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\nto her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been\\r\\nher firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened; she\\r\\nlonged to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.  You\\r\\nare lucky in having such a master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am.  If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\ncould not meet with a better.  But I have always observed, that\\r\\nthey who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\\r\\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered,\\r\\nmost generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.  \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\nthought she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\nhim-- just as affable to the poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\nmore.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\nrelated the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,\\r\\nand the price of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly\\r\\namused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed\\r\\nher excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to\\r\\nthe subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as\\r\\nthey proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that\\r\\never lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\nnothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\nservants but will give him a good name.  Some people call him\\r\\nproud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.  To my fancy, it\\r\\nis only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n\"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a\\r\\nvery pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance\\r\\nand lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that\\r\\nit was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\ntaken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\ntowards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she\\r\\nshould enter the room.  \"And this is always the way with him,\"\\r\\nshe added.  \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to\\r\\nbe done in a moment.  There is nothing he would not do for\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\nwere all that remained to be shown.  In the former were many\\r\\ngood paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from\\r\\nsuch as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned\\r\\nto look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose\\r\\nsubjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\nhave little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth walked in\\r\\nquest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\nAt last it arrested her-- and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered\\r\\nto have sometimes seen when he looked at her.  She stood\\r\\nseveral minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation,\\r\\nand returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs.\\r\\nReynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s\\r\\nlifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more\\r\\ngentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\nthe height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed\\r\\non him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise\\r\\nis more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a\\r\\nbrother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s\\r\\nhappiness were in his guardianship!-- how much of pleasure or\\r\\npain was it in his power to bestow!-- how much of good or evil\\r\\nmust be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward\\r\\nby the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\r\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed\\r\\nhis eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper\\r\\nsentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she\\r\\nremembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\nbeen seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\nhousekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met\\r\\nthem at the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\nturned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\nwhile the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\nthe owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\nwhich led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\nhis appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.  Their\\r\\neyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\nthe deepest blush.  He absolutely started, and for a moment\\r\\nseemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself,\\r\\nadvanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in\\r\\nterms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to\\r\\nbe overcome.  Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to\\r\\nthe picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to\\r\\nassure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the\\r\\ngardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master,\\r\\nmust immediately have told it.  They stood a little aloof while\\r\\nhe was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\r\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what\\r\\nanswer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\\r\\nAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted,\\r\\nevery sentence that he uttered was increasing her\\r\\nembarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her\\r\\nbeing found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in\\r\\nwhich they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\r\\nher life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke,\\r\\nhis accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\r\\ninquiries as to the time of  her having left Longbourn, and of her\\r\\nhaving stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way,\\r\\nas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\nfew moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\nhimself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed\\r\\nby her own feelings, followed them in silence.  She was\\r\\noverpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was\\r\\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\\r\\nHow strange it must appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light\\r\\nmight it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had\\r\\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she\\r\\ncome?  Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\\r\\nHad they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been\\r\\nbeyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he\\r\\nwas that moment arrived-- that moment alighted from his horse\\r\\nor his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the\\r\\nperverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly\\r\\naltered-- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to her\\r\\nwas amazing!-- but to speak with such civility, to inquire after\\r\\nher family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little\\r\\ndignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this\\r\\nunexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to his last\\r\\naddress in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\\r\\nShe  knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\nand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or\\r\\na finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but\\r\\nit was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\nthough she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of\\r\\nher uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such\\r\\nobjects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the\\r\\nscene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of\\r\\nPemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\r\\nwas.  She longed to know what at the moment was passing in\\r\\nhis mind-- in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in\\r\\ndefiance of everything, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he\\r\\nhad been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had\\r\\nbeen THAT in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether he\\r\\nhad felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not\\r\\ntell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\\r\\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\\r\\nappearing more like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\nwhile, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\\r\\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\\r\\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,\\r\\nwith the long range of woods overspreading many, and\\r\\noccasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\r\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a\\r\\nwalk.  With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten\\r\\nmiles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the\\r\\naccustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time,\\r\\nin a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water,\\r\\nand one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple\\r\\nbridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a\\r\\nspot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley,\\r\\nhere contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\r\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which\\r\\nbordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when\\r\\nthey had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from\\r\\nthe house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go\\r\\nno farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as\\r\\nquickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit,\\r\\nand they took their way towards the house on the opposite side\\r\\nof the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was\\r\\nslow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste,\\r\\nwas very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching\\r\\nthe occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and\\r\\ntalking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\\r\\nWhilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again\\r\\nsurprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what\\r\\nit had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them,\\r\\nand at no great distance.  The walk here being here less\\r\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\nthey met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\nprepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear\\r\\nand to speak with calmness, if we really intended to meet them.\\r\\nFor a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably\\r\\nstrike into some other path.  The idea lasted while a turning in\\r\\nthe walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he\\r\\nwas immediately before them.  With a glance, she saw that he\\r\\nhad lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\r\\npoliteness, she began as they to admire the beauty of the place;\\r\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and\\r\\n\"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she\\r\\nfancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be\\r\\nmischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\nhe asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him\\r\\nto her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\nquite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\nbeing now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very\\r\\npeople against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to\\r\\nherself.  \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he\\r\\nknows who they are?  He takes them now for people of\\r\\nfashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she\\r\\nnamed their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him,\\r\\nto see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of\\r\\nhis decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful\\r\\ncompanions.  That he was SURPRISED by the connection was\\r\\nevident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from\\r\\ngoing away, turned his back with them, and entered into\\r\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner.  Elizabeth could not but be\\r\\npleased, could not but triumph.  It was consoling that he should\\r\\nknow she had some relations for whom there was no need to\\r\\nblush.  She listened most attentively to all that passed between\\r\\nthem, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her\\r\\nuncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often\\r\\nas he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering\\r\\nat the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing\\r\\nout those parts of the stream where there was usually most\\r\\nsport.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\nElizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth\\r\\nsaid nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\r\\nmust be all for herself.  Her astonishment, however, was\\r\\nextreme, and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so\\r\\naltered?  From what can it proceed?  It cannot be for ME-- it\\r\\ncannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened.  My\\r\\nreproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.  It\\r\\nis impossible that he should still love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after\\r\\ndescending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of\\r\\nsome curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\\r\\nIt originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of\\r\\nthe morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support,\\r\\nand consequently preferred her husband\\'s.  Mr. Darcy took her\\r\\nplace by her niece, and they walked on together.  After a short\\r\\nsilence, the lady first spoke.  She wished him to know that she\\r\\nhad been assured of his absence before she came to the place,\\r\\nand accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\r\\nvery unexpected-- \"for your housekeeper,\" she added,\\r\\n\"informed us that you would certainly not be here till\\r\\nto-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we\\r\\nunderstood that you were not immediately expected in the\\r\\ncountry.\"  He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\r\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a\\r\\nfew hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been\\r\\ntravelling.  \"They will join me early to-morrow ,\" he continued,\\r\\n\"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with\\r\\nyou-- Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.  Her thoughts were\\r\\ninstantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had\\r\\nbeen the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge\\r\\nby his complexion, HIS mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after\\r\\na pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\\r\\nWill you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister\\r\\nto your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\ngreat for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.  She\\r\\nimmediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\nbeing acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\nwithout looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to\\r\\nknow that is resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\nElizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\nflattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\nwas a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\nothers, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house-- but she declared\\r\\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At such\\r\\na time much might have been said, and silence was very\\r\\nawkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\\r\\nembargo on every subject.  At last she recollected that she had\\r\\nbeen travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\r\\ngreat perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-- and\\r\\nher patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the\\r\\ntete-a-tete was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up\\r\\nthey were all pressed to go into the house and take some\\r\\nrefreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\\r\\nside with utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\\r\\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking\\r\\nslowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\nthem pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\nhad expected.  \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\nunassuming,\" said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\r\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.  I can\\r\\nnow say with the housekeeper, that though some people may\\r\\ncall him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.  It was\\r\\nmore than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity\\r\\nfor such attention.  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very\\r\\ntrifling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as\\r\\nWickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for\\r\\nhis features are perfectly good.  But how came you to tell me\\r\\nthat he was so disagreeable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\nliked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\nshe had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\\r\\nreplied her uncle.  \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,\\r\\nbut said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I\\r\\nreally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\ncruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.  He\\r\\nhas not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something\\r\\npleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there is\\r\\nsomething of dignity in his countenance that would not give one\\r\\nan unfavourable idea of his heart.  But, to be sure, the good lady\\r\\nwho showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\r\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he is a liberal\\r\\nmaster, I suppose, and THAT in the eye of a servant\\r\\ncomprehends every virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\\r\\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that\\r\\nby what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions\\r\\nwere capable of a very different construction; and that his\\r\\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable,\\r\\nas they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation\\r\\nof this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\r\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually\\r\\nnaming her authority, but stating as such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were\\r\\nnow approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea\\r\\ngave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much\\r\\nengaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots\\r\\nin its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had\\r\\nbeen by the morning\\'s walk they had no sooner dined than she\\r\\nset off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the\\r\\nevening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed\\r\\nafter many years\\' discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\nElizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\ncould do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be\\r\\nacquainted with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\nvisit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\nconsequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\nof that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\nmorning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\\r\\nThey had been walking about the place with some of their new\\r\\nfriends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves\\r\\nfor dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage\\r\\ndrew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady\\r\\nin a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately\\r\\nrecognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no\\r\\nsmall degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them\\r\\nwith the honour which she expected.  Her uncle and aunt were\\r\\nall amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she\\r\\nspoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea\\r\\non the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they\\r\\nfelt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions\\r\\nfrom such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\\r\\nWhile these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the\\r\\nperturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment\\r\\nincreasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but\\r\\namongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality\\r\\nof the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more\\r\\nthan commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that\\r\\nevery power of pleasing would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\nwalked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose\\r\\nherself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and\\r\\naunt as made everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\nintroduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see\\r\\nthat her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as\\r\\nherself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss\\r\\nDarcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few\\r\\nminutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She\\r\\nfound it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a\\r\\nmonosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\nthough little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\nappearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than\\r\\nher brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face,\\r\\nand her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\\r\\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and\\r\\nunembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was\\r\\nmuch relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\nBingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\nto express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\nBingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\nentered the room.  All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been\\r\\nlong done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have\\r\\nstood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\nexpressed himself on seeing her again.  He inquired in a friendly,\\r\\nthough general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\nthe same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\npersonage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him.\\r\\nThe whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\\r\\nThe suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their\\r\\nniece directed their observation towards each with an earnest\\r\\nthough guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those\\r\\ninquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\r\\nit was to love.  Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in\\r\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration\\r\\nwas evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to\\r\\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to\\r\\ncompose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\\r\\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\\r\\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give\\r\\npleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready,\\r\\nGeorgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and,\\r\\noh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were\\r\\ndirected in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\ntalked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\nherself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to\\r\\ntrace a resemblance .  But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\ncould not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who\\r\\nhad been set up as a rival to Jane.  No look appeared on either\\r\\nside that spoke particular regard.  Nothing occurred between\\r\\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister.  On this point she\\r\\nwas soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\r\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation,\\r\\ndenoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness,\\r\\nand a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her,\\r\\nhad he dared.  He observed to her, at a moment when the others\\r\\nwere talking together, and in a tone which had something of real\\r\\nregret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing her\"; and, before she could reply, he added,\\r\\n\"It is above eight months.  We have not met since the 26th of\\r\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\\r\\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.\\r\\nThere was not much in the question, nor in the preceding\\r\\nremark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\\r\\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\nwhich she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its\\r\\nexistence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she\\r\\nsaw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good\\r\\nopinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago\\r\\nwould have been a disgrace-- when she saw him thus civil, not\\r\\nonly to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly\\r\\ndisdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford\\r\\nParsonage-- the difference, the change was so great, and struck\\r\\nso forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her\\r\\nastonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of\\r\\nhis dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\\r\\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\r\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no\\r\\nimportance could result from the success of his endeavours, and\\r\\nwhen even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions\\r\\nwere addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of\\r\\nthe ladies both of Netherfield as Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when\\r\\nthey arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him\\r\\nin expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and\\r\\nMiss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the\\r\\ncountry.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked\\r\\nher little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.  Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how SHE,\\r\\nwhom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\r\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.  Presuming\\r\\nhowever, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary\\r\\nembarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her\\r\\nhusband, who was fond or society, a perfect willingness to\\r\\naccept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the\\r\\nday after the next was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\nElizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many\\r\\ninquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nconstruing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister,\\r\\nwas pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found\\r\\nherself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the\\r\\nlast half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was\\r\\npassing, the enjoyment of it had been little.  Eager to be alone,\\r\\nand fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she\\r\\nstayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable\\r\\nopinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity;\\r\\nit was not their wish to force her communication.  It was evident\\r\\nthat she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they\\r\\nhad before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in\\r\\nlove with her.  They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\ninquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\nas far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\nThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they\\r\\ndrawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\\'s\\r\\nreport, without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\nHertfordshire to which he was known would not have\\r\\nrecognized it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest,\\r\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\\r\\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him\\r\\nsince he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated\\r\\nrespectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had\\r\\nanything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends\\r\\nthat could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to\\r\\naccuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it\\r\\nwould certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\\r\\nmarket-town where the family did not visit.  It was\\r\\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\\r\\nmuch good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\nnot held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\nconcerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly\\r\\nunderstood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\\r\\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\\r\\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\nmore than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\nseemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\ntowards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole\\r\\nhours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not\\r\\nhate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had\\r\\nalmost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against\\r\\nhim, that could be so called.  The respect created by the\\r\\nconviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly\\r\\nadmitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her\\r\\nfeeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier\\r\\nnature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing\\r\\nforward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday\\r\\nhad produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there\\r\\nwas  a motive within her of goodwill which could not be\\r\\noverlooked.  It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having\\r\\nonce loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all\\r\\nthe petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and\\r\\nall the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who,\\r\\nshe had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,\\r\\nseemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the\\r\\nacquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or\\r\\nany peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\\r\\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\\r\\nbent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a\\r\\nman of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\\r\\ngratitude-- for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\\r\\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by\\r\\nno means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\\r\\nShe respected, she esteemed, he was grateful to him, she felt a\\r\\nreal interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\r\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far\\r\\nit would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the\\r\\npower, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing\\r\\non her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\nniece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to\\r\\nsee them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she\\r\\nhad reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated,\\r\\nthough it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness\\r\\non their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly\\r\\nexpedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\\r\\nThey were, therefore, to go.  Elizabeth was pleased; though\\r\\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.  The fishing scheme\\r\\nhad been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement\\r\\nmade of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before\\r\\nnoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of\\r\\nher had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\nunwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and\\r\\nwas curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side\\r\\nthe acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into\\r\\nthe saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for\\r\\nsummer.  Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most\\r\\nrefreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and\\r\\nof the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were\\r\\nscattered over the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\\r\\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady\\r\\nwith whom she lived in London.  Georgiana\\'s reception of them\\r\\nwas very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,\\r\\nthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong,\\r\\nwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief\\r\\nof her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\r\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\ncurtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\npauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was\\r\\nfirst broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking\\r\\nwoman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse\\r\\nproved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;\\r\\nand between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\r\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked\\r\\nas if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes\\r\\ndid venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its\\r\\nbeing heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\nDarcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not\\r\\nhave prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not\\r\\nbeen seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to\\r\\nbe spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts were\\r\\nemploying her.  She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\ngentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared that\\r\\nthe master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\r\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\\r\\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from\\r\\nher a cold inquiry after the health of her family.  She answered\\r\\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by\\r\\nthe entrance of the servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\\r\\nof all the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a\\r\\nvariety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take\\r\\nplace till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.\\r\\nAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her\\r\\npost.  There was now employment for the whole party-- for\\r\\nthough they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\r\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon\\r\\ncollected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\nand then, though but a moment before she had believed her\\r\\nwishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or\\r\\nthree other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,\\r\\nand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family\\r\\nintended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he\\r\\nappear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and\\r\\nunembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but\\r\\nperhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the\\r\\nsuspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and\\r\\nthat there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his\\r\\nbehaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance\\r\\nwas attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nin spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she\\r\\nspoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her\\r\\ndesperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means\\r\\nover.  Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself\\r\\nmuch more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that she was anxious for\\r\\nhis sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much\\r\\nas possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.  Miss\\r\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,\\r\\ntook the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from\\r\\nMeryton?  They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name;\\r\\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in\\r\\nher thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him\\r\\ngave her a moment\\'s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to\\r\\nrepel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question\\r\\nin a tolerably detached tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary\\r\\nglance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,\\r\\nearnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion,\\r\\nand unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley know what\\r\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly\\r\\nwould have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended\\r\\nto discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man\\r\\nto whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility\\r\\nwhich might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to\\r\\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some\\r\\npart of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a\\r\\nsyllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated\\r\\nelopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\r\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s\\r\\nconnections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,\\r\\nfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to\\r\\nhim, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly\\r\\nformed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect\\r\\nhis endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable\\r\\n that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare\\r\\nof his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\nemotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\\r\\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\\r\\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her\\r\\nbrother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her\\r\\ninterest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been\\r\\ndesigned to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\r\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to\\r\\ntheir carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms\\r\\non Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana\\r\\nwould not join her.  Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough\\r\\nto ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had\\r\\nspoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without\\r\\nthe power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\\r\\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\r\\n repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\"\\r\\nshe cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\nis since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa\\r\\nand I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\ncontented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no\\r\\nother alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\nconsequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never\\r\\ncould see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her\\r\\ncomplexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\\r\\nhandsome.  Her nose wants character-- there is nothing marked\\r\\nin its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\\r\\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so\\r\\nfine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.  They\\r\\nhave a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her\\r\\nair altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is\\r\\nintolerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,\\r\\nthis was not the best method of recommending herself; but\\r\\nangry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look\\r\\nsomewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was\\r\\nresolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making\\r\\nhim speak, she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how\\r\\namazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\nparticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\ndining at Netherfield, \\'SHE a beauty!  I should as soon call her\\r\\nmother a wit.\\'  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you,\\r\\nand I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but\\r\\nTHAT was only when I first saw her, for it is many months\\r\\nsince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of\\r\\nmy acquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\npain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned,\\r\\nexcept what had particularly interested them both.  The look and behaviour of everybody they had\\r\\nseen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked\\r\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit-- of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing\\r\\nto know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified\\r\\nby her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival\\r\\nat Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now\\r\\nbeen spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of\\r\\ntwo letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.\\r\\nElizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to\\r\\nenjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.  The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\r\\nwritten five days ago.  The beginning contained an account of\\r\\nall their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\ncountry afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\nlater, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\nintelligence.  It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\nof a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\nalarming you-- be assured that we are all well.  What I have to\\r\\nsay relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night,\\r\\n just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to\\r\\ninform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his\\r\\nofficers; to own the truth, with Wickham!  Imagine our surprise.\\r\\nTo Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I\\r\\nam very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides! But I\\r\\nam willing to hope the best, and that his character has been\\r\\nmisunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe\\r\\nhim, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad\\r\\nat heart.  His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know\\r\\nmy father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly\\r\\ngrieved.  My father bears it better.  How thankful am I that we\\r\\nnever let them know what has been said against him!  we must\\r\\nforget it ourselves.  They were off Saturday night about twelve,\\r\\nas is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\r\\neight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they\\r\\nmust have passed within ten miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives\\r\\nus reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his\\r\\nwife, informing her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I\\r\\ncannot be long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not\\r\\nbe able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\nknowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly\\r\\nseized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read\\r\\nas follows:  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of\\r\\nthe first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\nletter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\nconfined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\nfor being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\nImprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor\\r\\nLydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken\\r\\nplace, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\r\\nto Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left\\r\\nBrighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\\r\\nThough Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand\\r\\nthat they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped\\r\\nby Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go\\r\\nthere, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel\\r\\nF., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to\\r\\ntrace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no\\r\\nfurther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\r\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\r\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue\\r\\nthe London road.  I know not what to think.  After making\\r\\nevery possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on\\r\\ninto Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes,\\r\\nand at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--\\r\\nno such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest\\r\\nconcern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\r\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely\\r\\ngrieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame\\r\\non them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father\\r\\nand mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\\r\\nMany circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be\\r\\nmarried privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even\\r\\nif HE could form such a design against a young woman of\\r\\nLydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so\\r\\nlost to everything?  Impossible!  I grieve to find, however, that\\r\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\nshook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W.\\r\\nwas not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\nkeeps her room.  Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\nthis is not to be expected.  And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\nlife saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\nconcealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\none cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\r\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but\\r\\nnow, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your\\r\\nreturn?  I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\ninconvenient.  Adieu!  I take up my pen again to do what I\\r\\nhave just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that\\r\\nI cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\npossible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\nask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do\\r\\nI am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\\r\\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\\r\\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow\\r\\nevening.  In such and exigence, my uncle\\'s advice and assistance\\r\\nwould be everything in the world; he will immediately\\r\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from\\r\\nher seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\nwithout losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\nreached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\nappeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,\\r\\nand before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose\\r\\nmind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily\\r\\nexclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must\\r\\nfind Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\\r\\ndelayed; I have not an instant to loose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling\\r\\nthan politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you\\r\\na minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.  You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\nfelt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\nCalling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him,\\r\\nthough in so breathless an accent as made her almost\\r\\nunintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\\r\\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\\r\\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of\\r\\ngentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid.  Is\\r\\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief?  A\\r\\nglass of wine; shall I get you one?  You are very ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n \"There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite well; I am\\r\\nonly distressed by some dreadful news which I have just\\r\\nreceived from Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\ncould not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched suspense,\\r\\ncould only say something indistinctly of his concern, and\\r\\nobserve her in compassionate silence.  At length she spoke\\r\\nagain.  \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful\\r\\nnews. It cannot be concealed from any one.  My younger sister\\r\\nhas left all her friends-- has eloped; has thrown herself into the\\r\\npower of-- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off together from\\r\\nBrighton.  YOU know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has\\r\\nno money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to-- she\\r\\nis lost for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.  \"When I consider,\" she added\\r\\nin a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!\\r\\nI, who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part of\\r\\nit only-- some part of what I learnt, to my own family!  Had his\\r\\ncharacter been known, this could not have happened.  But it is\\r\\nall-- all too late now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved-- shocked.  But is\\r\\nit certain-- absolutely certain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and\\r\\nwere traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\\r\\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\nuncle\\'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\nhalf-an-hour.  But nothing can be done-- I know very well that\\r\\nnothing can be done.  How is such a man to be worked on?\\r\\nHow are they even to be discovered?  I have not the smallest\\r\\nhope.  It is every way horrible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character-- Oh! had I\\r\\nknown what I ought, what I dared to do!  But I knew not-- I\\r\\nwas afraid of doing too much.  Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and\\r\\nwas walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his\\r\\nbrow contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\ninstantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; everything\\r\\nMUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an\\r\\nassurance of the deepest disgrace.  She could neither wonder\\r\\nnor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\r\\nto her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her\\r\\ndistress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her\\r\\nunderstand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt\\r\\nthat she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be\\r\\nvain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.  Lydia--\\r\\nthe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon\\r\\nswallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her\\r\\nhandkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and,\\r\\nafter a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of\\r\\nher situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner\\r\\nwhich, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint,\\r\\nsaid, \"I am afraid you have been  long desiring my absence, nor\\r\\nhave I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though\\r\\nunavailing concern.  Would to Heaven that anything could be\\r\\neither said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\r\\nsuch distress!  But I will not torment you with vain wishes,\\r\\nwhich may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.  This\\r\\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.  Say\\r\\nthat urgent business calls us home immediately.  Conceal the\\r\\nunhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his\\r\\nsorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\\r\\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\\r\\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\\r\\nlook went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was\\r\\nthat they should ever see each other again on such terms of\\r\\ncordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire;\\r\\nand as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\nacquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\nthe perverseness of those feelings which would now have\\r\\npromoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in\\r\\nits termination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\nfaulty.  But if otherwise-- if regard springing from such sources\\r\\nis unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\ndescribed as arising on a first interview with its object, and even\\r\\nbefore two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\nher defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\nlatter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\nsuccess might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\ninteresting mode of attachment.  Be that as it may, she saw him\\r\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy\\r\\nmust produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\nwretched business.  Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter,\\r\\nhad she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her.\\r\\nNo one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\nexpectation.  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\ndevelopment.  While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\nher mind, she was all surprise-- all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\nshould marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had\\r\\nappeared incomprehensible.  But no it was all too natural. For\\r\\nsuch an attachment as this she might have sufficient charm; and\\r\\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in\\r\\nan elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\nunderstanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\\r\\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was\\r\\nconvinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach\\r\\nherself to anybody.  Sometimes one officer, sometimes another,\\r\\nhad been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her\\r\\nopinion.  Her affections had continually been fluctuating but\\r\\nnever without an object.  The mischief of neglect and mistaken\\r\\nindulgence towards such a girl-- oh! how acutely did she now\\r\\nfeel it!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was wild to be at home-- to hear, to see, to be upon the\\r\\nspot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly\\r\\nupon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\\r\\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and\\r\\nthough almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia,\\r\\nher uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and\\r\\ntill he entered the room her impatience was severe.  Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the\\r\\nservant\\'s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\r\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated\\r\\nthe cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and\\r\\ndwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy,\\r\\nthough Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.  Not Lydia\\r\\nonly, but all were concerned in it; and after the first\\r\\nexclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised\\r\\nevery assistance in his power.  Elizabeth, though expecting no\\r\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being\\r\\nactuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was\\r\\nspeedily settled.  They were to be off as soon as possible.  \"But\\r\\nwhat is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it\\r\\nso?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\nengagement.  THAT is all settled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\nroom to prepare.  \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\ndisclose the real truth?  Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\nin the hurry and confusion of the following hour.  Had Elizabeth\\r\\nbeen at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\nall employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself;\\r\\nbut she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and\\r\\namongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their\\r\\nfriends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden\\r\\ndeparture.  An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and\\r\\nMr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn,\\r\\nnothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all\\r\\nthe misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of\\r\\ntime than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and\\r\\non the road to Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle,\\r\\nas they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious\\r\\nconsideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\nyour eldest sister does on the matter.  It appears to me so very\\r\\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design against\\r\\na girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who\\r\\nwas actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly\\r\\ninclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends\\r\\nwould not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again\\r\\nby the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His\\r\\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your\\r\\nuncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\nhonour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.  I cannot think so\\r\\nvery ill of Wickham.  Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give\\r\\nhim up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\nneglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\nBut I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland\\r\\nif that had been the case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute\\r\\nproof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\nsuch a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\nfound on the Barnet road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then-- supposing them to be in London.  They may be there,\\r\\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\npurpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\neither side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\neconomically, though less expeditiously, married in London\\r\\nthan in Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must\\r\\ntheir marriage be private?  Oh, no, no-- this is not likely.  His\\r\\nmost particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was\\r\\npersuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will\\r\\nnever marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford\\r\\nit.  And what claims has Lydia-- what attraction has she beyond\\r\\nyouth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her\\r\\nsake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying\\r\\nwell?  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the\\r\\ncorps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am\\r\\nnot able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a\\r\\nstep might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid\\r\\nit will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward;\\r\\nand he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his\\r\\nindolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to\\r\\nwhat was going forward in his family, that HE would do as\\r\\nlittle, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such\\r\\na matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\nof him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and\\r\\nvirtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really, I\\r\\nknow not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.  But\\r\\nshe is very young; she has never been taught to think on\\r\\nserious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\ntwelvemonth-- she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\r\\nand vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\\r\\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that\\r\\ncame in her way.  Since the  ----shire were first quartered in\\r\\nMeryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in\\r\\nher head.  She has been doing everything in her power by\\r\\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater-- what shall\\r\\nI call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\nenough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\r\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very\\r\\nill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever\\r\\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\nsuch an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane\\r\\nknows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know\\r\\nthat he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he\\r\\nhas neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\nas he is insinuating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring.  \"I told you, the\\r\\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\nyourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he\\r\\nspoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\\r\\nliberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which\\r\\nI am not at liberty-- which it is not worth while to relate; but his\\r\\nlies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what\\r\\nhe said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\r\\nreserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\\r\\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we\\r\\nhave found her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this?  can she be ignorant of\\r\\nwhat you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\nsaw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I\\r\\nreturned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\nfortnight\\'s time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\nrelated the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\nknowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\none, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of\\r\\nhim should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled\\r\\nthat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\r\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could\\r\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\\r\\nThat such a consequence as THIS could ensue, you may easily\\r\\nbelieve, was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\\r\\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\neither side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\nmust be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\nthrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\nenough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or near\\r\\nMeryton was out of her senses about him for the first two\\r\\nmonths; but he never distinguished HER by any particular\\r\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of\\r\\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way,\\r\\nand others of the regiment, who treated her with more\\r\\ndistinction, again became her favourites.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\\r\\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting\\r\\nsubject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them\\r\\nfrom it long, during the whole of the journey.  From Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nthoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all\\r\\nanguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or\\r\\nforgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\nnight on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next\\r\\nday.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could\\r\\nnot have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\nand, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\nthat lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole\\r\\nbodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing\\r\\nearnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\nkiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\ndown from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled\\r\\nthe eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything\\r\\nhad been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane.  \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\nhope everything will be well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have heard only twice.  He wrote me a few lines on\\r\\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me\\r\\nhis directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely\\r\\nadded that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\nimportance to mention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my mother-- how is she?  How are you all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\ngreatly shaken.  She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\nin seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\\r\\nMary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you-- how are you?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"You look pale.\\r\\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\ntheir conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were engaged with their children,. Was now put an end\\r\\nto by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\naunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate\\r\\nsmiles and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\nElizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\nothers, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\ngive.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\\r\\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\\r\\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every\\r\\nmorning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her\\r\\nfather, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\\r\\ntheir marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation together, received them exactly as might\\r\\nbe expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\nagainst the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of\\r\\nher own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the\\r\\nperson to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her\\r\\ndaughter must principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to\\r\\nBrighton, with all my family, THIS would not have happened;\\r\\nbut poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.  Why did\\r\\nthe Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there\\r\\nwas some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\nkind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\\r\\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;\\r\\nbut I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child!  And now\\r\\nhere\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\nWickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\nwhat is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\nbefore he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\nbrother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\nfamily, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\nand would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\nLydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\\r\\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\\r\\non it a certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\\r\\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we\\r\\nknow that they are not married, and have no design of marrying,\\r\\ndo not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to\\r\\ntown I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with\\r\\nme to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as\\r\\nto what is to be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly\\r\\nwhat I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to\\r\\ntown, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not\\r\\nmarried already, MAKE them marry.  And as for wedding\\r\\nclothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall\\r\\nhave as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they\\r\\nare married.  And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\r\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out\\r\\nof my wits-- and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all\\r\\nover me-- such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and\\r\\nsuch beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\\r\\nAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her\\r\\nclothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are\\r\\nthe best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I know\\r\\nyou will contrive it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\nendeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending\\r\\nmoderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after\\r\\ntalking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they\\r\\nall left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who\\r\\nattended in the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\nattempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\nenough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they\\r\\nwaited at table, and judged it better that ONE only of the\\r\\nhousehold, and the one whom they could most trust should\\r\\ncomprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty,\\r\\nwho had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments\\r\\nto make their appearance before.  One came from her books,\\r\\nand the other from her toilette.  The faces of both, however,\\r\\nwere tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except\\r\\nthat the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had\\r\\nherself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness\\r\\nthan usual to the accents of Kitty.  As for Mary, she was\\r\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a\\r\\ncountenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\\r\\ntable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\ntalked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into\\r\\nthe wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\\r\\nconsolation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\nadded, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw\\r\\nfrom it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\nirretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\nthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that\\r\\nshe cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\nundeserving of the other sex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\noppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to\\r\\nconsole herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil\\r\\nbefore them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\nherself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane\\r\\nwas equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general\\r\\nlamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\nElizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\nnot assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\nsubject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\r\\nI have not already heard.  Give me further particulars.  What did\\r\\nColonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\nbefore the elopement took place?  They must have seen them\\r\\ntogether for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\npartiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any\\r\\nalarm.  I am so grieved for him!  His behaviour was attentive and\\r\\nkind to the utmost.  He WAS coming to us, in order to assure us\\r\\nof his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to\\r\\nScotland:  when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\nhis journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\\r\\nDid he know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster\\r\\nseen Denny himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied knowing\\r\\nanything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\nabout it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\nmarrying-- and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\\r\\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\\r\\nI felt a little uneasy-- a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with\\r\\nhim in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been\\r\\nalways quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that;\\r\\nthey only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then\\r\\nowned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the\\r\\nrest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter she had prepared her for\\r\\nsuch a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with\\r\\neach other, many weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\\r\\nhimself?  Does he know he real character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\nformerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left\\r\\nMeryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew\\r\\nof him, this could not have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.  \"But to\\r\\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what\\r\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.  We acted with\\r\\nthe best intentions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to\\r\\nhis wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\nThese were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,--\\r\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot\\r\\nhelp laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as\\r\\nsoon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you\\r\\ncannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there\\r\\nis but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should\\r\\nnever be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You\\r\\nneed not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do\\r\\nnot like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write\\r\\nto them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\'  What a good joke\\r\\nit will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make my\\r\\nexcuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing\\r\\nwith him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\\r\\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we\\r\\nmeet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I\\r\\nget to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a\\r\\ngreat slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\\r\\nGood-bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will\\r\\ndrink to our good journey.  Your affectionate friend,\\r\\n                              \"Lydia Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\nhad finished it.  What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\nmoment!  But at least it shows that SHE was serious on the\\r\\nsubject of their journey.  Whatever he might afterwards\\r\\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of\\r\\ninfamy.  My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak a word\\r\\nfor full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately, and\\r\\nthe whole house in such confusion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it\\r\\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I hope there was.  But to be guarded at such a\\r\\ntime is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\nendeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am\\r\\nafraid I did not do so much as I might have done!  But the\\r\\nhorror of what might possibly happen almost took from me\\r\\nmy faculties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do\\r\\nnot look well.  Oh that I had been with you!  you have had every\\r\\ncare and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of\\r\\nthem.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\nthat her hours of repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt\\r\\nPhillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went\\r\\naway; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.  She\\r\\nwas of great use and comfort to us all.  And Lady Lucas has\\r\\nbeen very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\r\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\\r\\ndaughters\\', if they should be of use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps\\r\\nshe MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\ncannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours.  Assistance is\\r\\nimpossible; condolence insufferable.  Let them triumph over us\\r\\nat a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\\r\\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of\\r\\nhis daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place\\r\\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\nanything could be made out from them.  His principal object\\r\\nmust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which\\r\\ntook them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from\\r\\nLondon; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\r\\ngentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another\\r\\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.  If\\r\\nhe could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had\\r\\nbefore set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there,\\r\\nand hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and\\r\\nnumber of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that\\r\\nhe had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his\\r\\nspirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\r\\nout even so much as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\nnext morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\nfrom him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions,\\r\\na most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\nthey had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that\\r\\nhe had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they\\r\\nwould have been glad to be certain.  Mr. Gardiner had waited\\r\\nonly for the letters before he set off.\\r\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\nconstant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\nsister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s\\r\\nnot being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire\\r\\na few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\nserviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\nfreedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\nalways, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\nthem up-- though, as she never came without reporting some\\r\\nfresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she\\r\\nseldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\\r\\nshe found them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was\\r\\ndeclared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his\\r\\nintrigues all honoured with the title of seduction, had been\\r\\nextended into every tradesman\\'s family.  Everybody declared\\r\\nthat he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\r\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted\\r\\nthe appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not\\r\\ncredit above half of what was said, believed enough to make\\r\\nher former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even\\r\\nJane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more\\r\\nespecially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to\\r\\nScotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they\\r\\nmust in all probability have gained some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\nreceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\nhad immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to\\r\\ncome to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to\\r\\nEpsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining\\r\\nany satisfactory information; and that he was now determined\\r\\nto inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\r\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on\\r\\ntheir first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\\r\\nMr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this\\r\\nmeasure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist\\r\\nhim in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly\\r\\ndisinclined at present to leave London and promised to write\\r\\nagain very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\npossible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the\\r\\nregiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\\r\\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\\r\\nconcealed himself.  If there were any one that one could apply\\r\\nto with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be\\r\\nof essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide\\r\\nus.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power\\r\\nto satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\r\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than\\r\\nany other person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\\r\\ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her\\r\\npower to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the\\r\\ncompliment deserved.  She had never heard of his having had\\r\\nany relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had\\r\\nbeen dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of\\r\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more\\r\\ninformation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\r\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The\\r\\narrival of letters was the grand object of every morning\\'s\\r\\nimpatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be\\r\\ntold would be communicated, and every succeeding day was\\r\\nexpected to bring some news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\nfor their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\nwhich, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\nhim in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who\\r\\nknew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her,\\r\\nand read it likewise. It was s follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--\\r\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in\\r\\nlife, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\r\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\r\\nfrom Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins\\r\\nand myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\nrespectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\nthe bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no\\r\\n time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part\\r\\nthat can alleviate so severe a misfortune-- or that may comfort\\r\\nyou, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most\\r\\nafflicting to a parent\\'s mind.  The death of your daughter would\\r\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of  this.  And it is the more\\r\\nto be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear\\r\\nCharlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in\\r\\nyour daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\nthough, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition\\r\\nmust be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an\\r\\nenormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are\\r\\ngrievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by\\r\\nMrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter,\\r\\nto whom I have related the affair.  They agree with me in\\r\\napprehending that this false step in one daughter will be\\r\\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\\r\\nwith such a family?  And this consideration leads me moreover\\r\\nto reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\\r\\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\r\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me then advise you, dear\\r\\nsir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your\\r\\nunworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\r\\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offense.-- I am, dear sir, etc.,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\nnature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\nrelationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\ncertain that he had no  near one living.  His former\\r\\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\r\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\\r\\nfriendship with any of them.  There was no one, therefore, who\\r\\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in\\r\\nthe wretched state of his own finances, there was a very\\r\\npowerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery\\r\\nby Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left\\r\\ngaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\r\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed\\r\\na good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\r\\nformidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\\r\\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.  Jane heard them with\\r\\nhorror.  \"A gamester!\" she cried.  \"This is wholly unexpected.\\r\\nI had not an idea of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\ntheir father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he\\r\\nhad yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return\\r\\nto his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might\\r\\nsuggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs.\\r\\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction\\r\\nas her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his\\r\\nlife had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried.\\r\\n\"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who\\r\\nis to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes\\r\\naway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled\\r\\nthat she and the children should go to London, at the same time\\r\\nthat Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them\\r\\nthe first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\nLongbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth\\r\\nand her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part\\r\\nof the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned\\r\\nbefore them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter\\r\\nfrom him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none\\r\\nsince her return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\\r\\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\\r\\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though\\r\\nElizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with\\r\\nher own feelings, was perfectly  aware that, had she known\\r\\nnothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s\\r\\ninfamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought,\\r\\none sleepless night out of two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\nphilosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\nthe habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\ntaken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\ncourage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\nthat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\nher briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have\\r\\nendured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that.  Who should suffer\\r\\nbut myself?  It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is\\r\\nso prone to fall into it!  No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel\\r\\nhow much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being\\r\\noverpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence\\r\\nthere will probably be of some duration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to\\r\\nme last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\ngreatness of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\nmother\\'s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such\\r\\nan elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I\\r\\nwill sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and\\r\\ngive as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till\\r\\nKitty runs away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully.  \"If I\\r\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU go to Brighton.  I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\nEastbourne for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\nbe cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever\\r\\nto enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\nvillage.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\nwith one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\ntill you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\nin a rational manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy.  If you\\r\\nare a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\nat the end of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw\\r\\nthe housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she\\r\\ncame to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;\\r\\nbut, instead of the expected summons, when they approached\\r\\nher, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for\\r\\ninterrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\r\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t\\r\\nyou know there is an express come for master from Mr.\\r\\nGardiner?  He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\\r\\na letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\nthence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\non the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when\\r\\nthey were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking\\r\\ntowards the little copse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\nonce more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\ndeliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side\\r\\nof the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\\r\\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\nbreath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, what news-- what news?  Have you heard from my\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring-- good or bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\\r\\nletter from his pocket.  \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what\\r\\nit is about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                    \"Gracechurch Street, Monday,\"\\r\\n                              \"August 2.\\r\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,--\\r\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and\\r\\nsuch as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\\r\\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to\\r\\nfind out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I\\r\\nreserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\\r\\nI have seen them both-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\nthere was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\nperform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\r\\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is\\r\\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\r\\nequal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\nyour life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.  I shall send\\r\\nthis by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your\\r\\nanswer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they\\r\\nare generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in\\r\\nthat respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little\\r\\nmoney, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my\\r\\nniece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will be\\r\\nthe case, you send me full powers to act in your name\\r\\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give\\r\\ndirections to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\\r\\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town\\r\\nagain; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my\\r\\ndiligence and care.  Send back your answer as fast as you can,\\r\\nand be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that\\r\\nmy niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\r\\nyou will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as\\r\\nsoon as anything more is determined on.  Yours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.  \"Can it\\r\\nbe possible that he will marry her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said\\r\\nher sister.  \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time\\r\\nbefore he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\\r\\nimmediately.  Consider how important every moment is in such\\r\\na case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards\\r\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose,\\r\\nmust be complied with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they MUST marry!  Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done.\\r\\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is,\\r\\nhow much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about;\\r\\nand the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money!  My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so\\r\\nslight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and\\r\\nfifty after I am gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred\\r\\nto me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\nremain!  Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings!  Generous, good\\r\\nman, I am afraid he has distressed himself.  A small sum could\\r\\nnot do all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\nfarthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to\\r\\nthink so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a\\r\\nsum to be repaid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then\\r\\nwent on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\nbreakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon\\r\\nas they were by themselves.  \"How strange this is!  And for\\r\\nTHIS we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as\\r\\nis their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character,\\r\\nwe are forced to rejoice.  Oh, Lydia!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly\\r\\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\\r\\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\nhim, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\nit, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may\\r\\nhave more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\"\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\nsister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\nthem, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The\\r\\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their\\r\\ntaking her home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\ncountenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\ngratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she is\\r\\nactually with them!  If such goodness does not make her\\r\\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a\\r\\nmeeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\"\\r\\nsaid Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.  His\\r\\nconsenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come\\r\\nto a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will steady\\r\\nthem; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in\\r\\nso rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence\\r\\nforgotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither\\r\\nyou, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.  It is useless to talk of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\nlikelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.  They went\\r\\nto the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\nnot wish them to make it known to her.  He was writing and,\\r\\nwithout raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\nupstairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\none communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight\\r\\npreparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s  being soon married, her joy\\r\\nburst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\r\\nexuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from\\r\\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\\r\\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She\\r\\nwas disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\\r\\nremembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried.  \"This is delightful indeed!\\r\\nShe will be married!  I shall see her again!  She will be married at\\r\\nsixteen!  My good, kind brother!  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nknew he would manage everything!  How I long to see her!  and\\r\\nto see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\\r\\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy,\\r\\nmy dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will\\r\\ngive her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for\\r\\nHill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia!\\r\\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\nviolence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\nobligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a\\r\\ngreat measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has\\r\\npledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it\\r\\nbut her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\nmy children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\nfirst time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\npresents.  Well!  I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have a\\r\\ndaughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds!  And\\r\\nshe was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a\\r\\nflutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you\\r\\nwrite for me.  We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\nand cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very\\r\\nplentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,\\r\\npersuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be\\r\\nconsulted.  One day\\'s delay, she observed, would be of small\\r\\nimportance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so\\r\\nobstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\ntell the good, good news to my sister Philips.  And as I come\\r\\nback, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down\\r\\nand order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of\\r\\ngood, I am sure.  Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\\r\\nOh!  Here comes Hill!  My dear Hill, have you heard the good\\r\\nnews?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have\\r\\na bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received\\r\\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly,\\r\\ntook refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\nwas no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so; and\\r\\nthough, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\nworldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\nlooking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\nfelt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\nthat, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\nannual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\nwife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.\\r\\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\nindebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could\\r\\nnow be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on one\\r\\nof the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her\\r\\nhusband might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\nanyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\nthe extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\nsoon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\nperfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The\\r\\nson was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be\\r\\nof age, and the widow and younger children would by that\\r\\nmeans be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the\\r\\nworld, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many\\r\\nyears after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would.  This\\r\\nevent had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\nsaving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\r\\nhusband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their\\r\\nexceeding their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be\\r\\ndivided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was\\r\\nnow to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\nacceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful\\r\\nacknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\r\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\r\\nengagements that had been made for him.  He had never before\\r\\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\ndaughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\nhimself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be\\r\\nten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid\\r\\nthem; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the\\r\\ncontinual presents in money which passed to her through her\\r\\nmother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within\\r\\nthat sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\ntoo, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\nwas to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When\\r\\nthe first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\nseeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\nindolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\nin undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He\\r\\nbegged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to\\r\\nhis brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne\\r\\nin the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have\\r\\nbeen more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\\r\\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\\r\\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.  But\\r\\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\r\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded\\r\\nbefore from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little\\r\\nof their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\\r\\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\nand in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\ndamp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had\\r\\nbeen the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was\\r\\nnow on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her\\r\\nwords ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine\\r\\nmuslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily searching\\r\\nthrough the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her\\r\\ndaughter, and, without knowing of considering what their\\r\\nincome might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--\\r\\nor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\nbut Ashworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\nmiles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while\\r\\nthe servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said\\r\\nto her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses\\r\\nfor your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\\r\\nInto ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\nadmittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\nreceiving them at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\nfirm.  It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\\r\\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she\\r\\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\\r\\noccasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his\\r\\nanger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\r\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\\r\\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\\r\\nbelieve possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which her\\r\\nwant of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than\\r\\nto any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a\\r\\nfortnight before they took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\ndistress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\nwith their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would\\r\\nso shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they\\r\\nmight hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those\\r\\nwho were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\\r\\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more\\r\\nconfidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one\\r\\nwhose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her\\r\\nso much-- not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it\\r\\nindividually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf\\r\\nimpassable between them.  Had Lydia\\'s marriage been\\r\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family\\r\\nwhere, to every other objection, would now be added an\\r\\nalliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom\\r\\nhe so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would\\r\\nshrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had\\r\\nassured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational\\r\\nexpectation survive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she\\r\\nwas grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\\r\\nShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer\\r\\nhope to be benefited by it.  She wanted to hear of him, when\\r\\nthere seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.  She was\\r\\nconvinced that she could have been happy with him, when it\\r\\nwas no longer likely they should meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know\\r\\nthat the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four\\r\\nmonths ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully\\r\\nreceived!  He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most\\r\\ngenerous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a\\r\\ntriumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\\r\\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\\r\\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to\\r\\nthe advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might\\r\\nhave been softened, his manners improved; and from his\\r\\njudgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\r\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\\r\\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a\\r\\ndifferent tendency ,and precluding the possibility of the other,\\r\\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\nindependence, she could not imagine.  But how little of\\r\\npermanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only\\r\\nbrought together because their passions were stronger than their\\r\\nvirtue, she could easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet\\'s\\r\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\neagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\nconcluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\nmentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\nto inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\nmilitia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as\\r\\nsoon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree\\r\\nwith me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly\\r\\nadvisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s.  It is Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his\\r\\nformer friends, there are still some who are able and willing to\\r\\nassist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in\\r\\nGeneral ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an\\r\\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.  He\\r\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they\\r\\nmay each have a character to preserve, they will both be more\\r\\nprudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our\\r\\npresent arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\\r\\nvarious creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\\r\\nassurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\\r\\nAnd will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar\\r\\nassurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a\\r\\nlist according to his information?  He has given in all his debts; I\\r\\nhope at least he has not deceived us.  Haggerston has our\\r\\ndirections, and all will be completed in a week.  They will then\\r\\njoin his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and\\r\\nI understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous\\r\\nof seeing you all before she leaves the South.  She is well, and\\r\\nbegs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--\\r\\nYours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"E. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\\r\\nWickham\\'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\\r\\nGardiner could do.  But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\\r\\nwith it.  Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had\\r\\nexpected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had\\r\\nby no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nwas a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity\\r\\nthat Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was\\r\\nacquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, \"said she, \"it will be quite\\r\\nshocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young\\r\\nmen, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so\\r\\npleasant in General ----\\'s regiment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\nreceived at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and\\r\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her\\r\\nparents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,\\r\\nto receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they\\r\\nwere married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought,\\r\\nand act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction\\r\\nof knowing that she would be able to show her married\\r\\ndaughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\r\\nNorth.  When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\nhe sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\nas soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\nLongbourn.  Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham\\r\\nshould consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only\\r\\nher own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the\\r\\nlast object of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEIR sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\nfor her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage\\r\\nwas sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by\\r\\ndinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss\\r\\nBennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings\\r\\nwhich would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,\\r\\nand was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\nreceive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\ncarriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\ngrave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\nopen, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\nembraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,\\r\\nwith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;\\r\\nand wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt\\r\\nof their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,\\r\\nwas not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in\\r\\nausterity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy\\r\\nassurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke\\r\\nhim.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was\\r\\nshocked.  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild,\\r\\nnoisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister,\\r\\ndemanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\\r\\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\\r\\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it\\r\\nwas a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\nmanners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\nmarriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\naddress, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\ndelighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him\\r\\nquite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\\r\\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of\\r\\nan impudent man.  She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\r\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\\r\\nvariation of colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could\\r\\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\nsit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\nthat neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt\\r\\nvery unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them\\r\\nto have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the\\r\\npast was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to\\r\\nsubjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\\r\\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\\r\\nhave been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!\\r\\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married\\r\\ntill I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good\\r\\nfun if I was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\nany thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n\"Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married\\r\\nto-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William\\r\\nGoulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know\\r\\nit, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off\\r\\nmy glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so\\r\\nthat he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\\r\\nany thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of\\r\\nthe room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\\r\\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them\\r\\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her\\r\\nmother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,\\r\\n\"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,\\r\\nbecause I am a married woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\nembarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\nHer ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\nhear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and in the\\r\\nmean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring, and boast of\\r\\nbeing married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\nbreakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband?  Is not\\r\\nhe a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I\\r\\nonly hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to\\r\\nBrighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it\\r\\nis, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear\\r\\nLydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off.  Must it\\r\\nbe so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it\\r\\nof all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down\\r\\nand see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I\\r\\ndare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get\\r\\ngood partners for them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for\\r\\nthem before the winter is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\\r\\nMr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,\\r\\nand he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\nshort; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\nher daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These\\r\\nparties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was\\r\\neven more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\nexpected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him.  She had\\r\\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\\r\\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on\\r\\nby the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would\\r\\nhave wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose\\r\\nto elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\\r\\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\r\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an\\r\\nopportunity of having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\\r\\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would\\r\\nkill more birds on the first of September, than any body else\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\nher two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\\r\\nlittle said on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.\\r\\nWe were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s\\r\\nlodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we\\r\\nshould all be there by eleven o\\'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I\\r\\nwere to go together; and the others were to meet us at the\\r\\nchurch.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\\r\\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put\\r\\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And\\r\\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and\\r\\ntalking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I\\r\\ndid not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may\\r\\nsuppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would\\r\\nbe married in his blue coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\\r\\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\\r\\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\\r\\nwas with them.  If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my\\r\\nfoot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one\\r\\nparty, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather\\r\\nthin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so\\r\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away\\r\\nupon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you\\r\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\\r\\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my\\r\\nuncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we\\r\\ncould not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again\\r\\nin ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out.  However, I\\r\\nrecollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,\\r\\nthe wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\\r\\nas well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But\\r\\ngracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word\\r\\nabout it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham\\r\\nsay?  It was to be such a secret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\\r\\nthe subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\\r\\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\\r\\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it\\r\\nout of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\nleast it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad been at her sister\\'s wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and\\r\\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and\\r\\nleast temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,\\r\\nrapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\\r\\nwith none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\\r\\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not\\r\\nbear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote\\r\\na short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\r\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\\r\\nhad been intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity\\r\\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\nbeen amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let\\r\\nme understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to\\r\\nremain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and\\r\\nthen I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that I shall, though,\" she added to herself, as she\\r\\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me\\r\\nin an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\\r\\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\nglad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would\\r\\nreceive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\\r\\nconfidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\nletter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in\\r\\npossession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where\\r\\nshe was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of\\r\\nthe benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the\\r\\nletter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR NIECE,\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing\\r\\nwill not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess\\r\\nmyself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from\\r\\nyou.  Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let\\r\\nyou know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary\\r\\non your side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive\\r\\nmy impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am --\\r\\nand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\r\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are\\r\\nreally innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the\\r\\nvery day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a\\r\\nmost unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up\\r\\nwith him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so\\r\\nmy curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to\\r\\nhave been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out\\r\\nwhere your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen\\r\\nand talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\r\\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\r\\nourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\r\\nthem.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being\\r\\nowing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so\\r\\nwell known as to make it impossible for any young woman of\\r\\ncharacter to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the\\r\\nwhole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before\\r\\nthought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the\\r\\nworld.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it,\\r\\ntherefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an\\r\\nevil which had been brought on by himself.  If he had\\r\\nanother motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He\\r\\nhad been some days in town, before he was able to discover\\r\\nthem; but he had something to direct his search, which was more\\r\\nthan we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason\\r\\nfor his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a\\r\\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and\\r\\nwas dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation,\\r\\nthough he did not say what.  She then took a large house in\\r\\nEdward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\r\\nlodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted\\r\\nwith Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as\\r\\nsoon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he\\r\\ncould get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her\\r\\ntrust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she\\r\\nreally did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham\\r\\nindeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and\\r\\nhad she been able to receive them into her house, they would\\r\\nhave taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our\\r\\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in\\r\\n---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing\\r\\nLydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to\\r\\npersuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and\\r\\nreturn to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to\\r\\nreceive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\\r\\nBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she\\r\\nwas.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of\\r\\nhis; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they\\r\\nshould be married some time or other, and it did not much\\r\\nsignify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained,\\r\\nhe thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his\\r\\nvery first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had\\r\\nnever been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave\\r\\nthe regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\\r\\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences\\r\\nof Lydia\\'s flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign\\r\\nhis commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\\r\\ncould conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere,\\r\\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing\\r\\nto live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\\r\\nsister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very\\r\\nrich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his\\r\\nsituation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,\\r\\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\\r\\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some\\r\\nother country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not\\r\\nlikely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\nThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\nwas reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled\\r\\nbetween them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle\\r\\nacquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street\\r\\nthe evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\r\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father\\r\\nwas still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He\\r\\ndid not judge your father to be a person whom he could so\\r\\nproperly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\\r\\nseeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not\\r\\nleave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a\\r\\ngentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again.\\r\\nYour father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said\\r\\nbefore, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again\\r\\non Sunday, and then I saw him too.  It was not all settled\\r\\nbefore Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\r\\nLongbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy,\\r\\nLizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\nafter all.  He has been accused of many faults at different\\r\\ntimes, but this is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that\\r\\nhe did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it\\r\\nto be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle\\r\\nwould most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it\\r\\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the\\r\\ngentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your\\r\\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be\\r\\nof use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the\\r\\nprobable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and\\r\\nI really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\npleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\nof his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\nBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\nmost.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\\r\\nthe young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\r\\nbelieve, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\r\\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his\\r\\ncommission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done\\r\\nby him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to\\r\\nhim, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\r\\nWickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently\\r\\nthat he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there\\r\\nwas some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,\\r\\nor anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But\\r\\nin spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest\\r\\nperfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if\\r\\nwe had not given him credit for another interest in the\\r\\naffair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to\\r\\nhis friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was\\r\\nagreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding\\r\\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\\r\\nfinish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a\\r\\nrelation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;\\r\\nI hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\\r\\nLydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the\\r\\nhouse.  He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in\\r\\nHertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\r\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I\\r\\nhad not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her\\r\\nconduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and\\r\\ntherefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\\r\\nI talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\r\\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done,\\r\\nand all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she\\r\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\nlisten.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected\\r\\nmy dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience\\r\\nwith her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia\\r\\ninformed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next\\r\\nday, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\\r\\nWill you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this\\r\\nopportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say\\r\\nbefore) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every\\r\\nrespect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\r\\na little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently,\\r\\nhis wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly\\r\\never mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray\\r\\nforgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\r\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be\\r\\nquite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low\\r\\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\\r\\nthing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been\\r\\nwanting me this half hour.  Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\nM. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter\\r\\nof spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether\\r\\npleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and\\r\\nunsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what\\r\\nMr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match,\\r\\nwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness\\r\\ntoo great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\r\\njust, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their\\r\\ngreatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to\\r\\ntown, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\\r\\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\\r\\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and\\r\\nwhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\\r\\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished\\r\\nto avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\r\\npronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could\\r\\nneither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had\\r\\ndone it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other\\r\\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was\\r\\ninsufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her\\r\\n-- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to\\r\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\nrelationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every\\r\\nkind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be\\r\\nsure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he\\r\\nhad given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\r\\nextraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he\\r\\nshould feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had\\r\\nthe means of exercising it; and though she would not place\\r\\nherself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps,\\r\\nbelieve that remaining partiality for her might assist his\\r\\nendeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\r\\nmaterially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to\\r\\nknow that they were under obligations to a person who could\\r\\nnever receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\nher character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she\\r\\ngrieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\nevery saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For\\r\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that\\r\\nin a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\\r\\nthe better of himself.  She read over her aunt\\'s commendation\\r\\nof him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased\\r\\nher.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with\\r\\nregret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had\\r\\nbeen persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between\\r\\nMr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some\\r\\none\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path,\\r\\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\\r\\nsaid he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not\\r\\nfollow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  We were always good\\r\\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  Are the others coming out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\\r\\ncarriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find, from\\r\\nour uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\\r\\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to\\r\\nNewcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor\\r\\nReynolds, she was always very fond of me.  But of course she\\r\\ndid not mention my name to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\\r\\n-- not turned out well.  At such a distance as that, you\\r\\nknow, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips.  Elizabeth hoped she\\r\\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We passed\\r\\neach other several times.  I wonder what he can be doing\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"It must be something particular, to take him there\\r\\nat this time of year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\\r\\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\nthis year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\npromising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn\\r\\nout well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\nhad.  A most delightful place! -- Excellent Parsonage House!\\r\\nIt would have suited me in every respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\nduty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought\\r\\nnot to repine; -- but, to be sure, it would have been such a\\r\\nthing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would\\r\\nhave answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be.\\r\\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were\\r\\nin Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good,\\r\\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\npresent patron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have.  Yes, there was something in that; I told you so\\r\\nfrom the first, you may remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making\\r\\nwas not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that\\r\\nyou actually declared your resolution of never taking orders,\\r\\nand that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did!  and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may\\r\\nremember what I told you on that point, when first we talked\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she\\r\\nhad walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her\\r\\nsister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with\\r\\na good-humoured smile,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\\r\\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we\\r\\nshall be always of one mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\\r\\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\\r\\nentered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\nthat he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\nsister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\npleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwas forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by\\r\\nno means entered into her scheme of their all going to\\r\\nNewcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  I don\\'t know.  Not these two or three years,\\r\\nperhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As often as I can.  But you know married women have never much\\r\\ntime for writing.  My sisters may write to me.  They will\\r\\nhave nothing else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his\\r\\nwife\\'s.  He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\nout of the house, \"as ever I saw.  He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\nmakes love to us all.  I am prodigiously proud of him.  I defy\\r\\neven Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable\\r\\nson-in-law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\\r\\nseveral days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\\r\\nparting with one\\'s friends.  One seems so forlorn without\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying\\r\\na daughter,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It must make you better\\r\\nsatisfied that your other four are single.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\nmarried, but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be\\r\\nso far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone\\r\\nso soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\\r\\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\\r\\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be\\r\\nin circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received\\r\\norders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming\\r\\ndown in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  She looked at Jane, and\\r\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\\r\\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  \"Well, so\\r\\nmuch the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is\\r\\nnothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to\\r\\nsee him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\r\\nNetherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what may\\r\\nhappen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we\\r\\nagreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so,\\r\\nis it quite certain he is coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls\\r\\nwas in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out\\r\\nmyself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that\\r\\nit was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest,\\r\\nvery likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher\\'s, she\\r\\ntold me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she\\r\\nhas got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\nchanging colour.  It was many months since she had mentioned\\r\\nhis name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone\\r\\ntogether, she said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of\\r\\nthe present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But\\r\\ndon\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused\\r\\nfor the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.\\r\\nI do assure you that the news does not affect me either with\\r\\npleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\\r\\nbecause we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of\\r\\nmyself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen\\r\\nhim in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of\\r\\ncoming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but\\r\\nshe still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to\\r\\nthe greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s\\r\\npermission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man\\r\\ncannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\nraising all this speculation!  I will leave him to himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\nher feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\neasily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They\\r\\nwere more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\nparents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"you will wait on him of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and\\r\\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my\\r\\ndaughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on\\r\\na fool\\'s errand again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\nattention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he.  \"If he wants our\\r\\nsociety, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not\\r\\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\ngo away and come back again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\nnot wait on him.  But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking\\r\\nhim to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and\\r\\nthe Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so\\r\\nthere will be just room at table for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\\r\\nher husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know\\r\\nthat her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence\\r\\nof it, before they did.  As the day of his arrival drew near,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\\r\\nsister.  \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\ntalked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\ncan know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I\\r\\nbe, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel\\r\\nit; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a\\r\\nsufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\nservants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that\\r\\nthe period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as\\r\\nlong as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene\\r\\nbefore their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him\\r\\nbefore.  But on the third morning after his arrival in\\r\\nHertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\r\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane\\r\\nresolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to\\r\\nsatisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she\\r\\nsaw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it\\r\\nbe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I\\r\\ndo not know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\\r\\nbe with him before.  Mr. what\\'s-his-name.  That tall, proud\\r\\nman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Mr. Darcy! -- and so it does, I vow.  Well,\\r\\nany friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be\\r\\nsure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew\\r\\nbut little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt\\r\\nfor the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him\\r\\nalmost for the first time after receiving his explanatory\\r\\nletter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for\\r\\nthe other, and of course for themselves; and their mother\\r\\ntalked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to\\r\\nbe civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being\\r\\nheard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of\\r\\nuneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she\\r\\nhad never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to\\r\\nrelate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he\\r\\ncould be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose\\r\\nmerit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\r\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were\\r\\nindebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded\\r\\nherself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as\\r\\nreasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her\\r\\nastonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\nLongbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal\\r\\nto what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour\\r\\nin Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for\\r\\nhalf a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight\\r\\nadded lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time\\r\\nthat his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she\\r\\nwould not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be\\r\\nearly enough for expectation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\ndaring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\nto the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\ndoor.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate\\r\\nthan Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her\\r\\ncolour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease,\\r\\nand with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom\\r\\nof resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\nsat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\noften command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He\\r\\nlooked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\nPemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence\\r\\nbe what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful,\\r\\nbut not an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that\\r\\nshort period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He\\r\\nwas received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which\\r\\nmade her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with\\r\\nthe cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address\\r\\nto his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\nlatter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\nquestion which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\nscarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was\\r\\nthe reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\\r\\nDerbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could\\r\\nnot to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without\\r\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\\r\\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his\\r\\nface, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and\\r\\nfrequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness\\r\\nand less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were\\r\\nplainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with\\r\\nherself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she.  \"Yet why did\\r\\nhe come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself;\\r\\nand to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.  \"I began to be afraid you would never come back\\r\\nagain.  People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\nbut, however, I hope it is not true.  A great many changes have\\r\\nhappened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.  Miss Lucas\\r\\nis married and settled.  And one of my own daughters.\\r\\nI suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen\\r\\nit in the papers.  It was in The Times and The Courier, I\\r\\nknow; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only\\r\\nsaid, ``Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\'\\'\\r\\nwithout there being a syllable said of her father, or the place\\r\\nwhere she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother Gardiner\\'s\\r\\ndrawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an\\r\\nawkward business of it.  Did you see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.  How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\ntherefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter\\r\\nwell married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time,\\r\\nMr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from\\r\\nme.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward,\\r\\nit seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\\r\\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his\\r\\nleaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\\r\\nThank Heaven!  he has some friends, though perhaps not so\\r\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was\\r\\nin such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\\r\\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\\r\\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked\\r\\nBingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at\\r\\npresent.  A few weeks, he believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as\\r\\nmany as you please on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor.  I am sure he\\r\\nwill be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the\\r\\nbest of the covies for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such\\r\\nofficious attention!  Were the same fair prospect to arise at\\r\\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was\\r\\npersuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\\r\\nAt that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not\\r\\nmake Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\\r\\nmore to be in company with either of them.  Their society can\\r\\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\\r\\nthis!  Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\nobserving how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\nadmiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had\\r\\nspoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\ngiving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as\\r\\nshe had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,\\r\\nthough not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no\\r\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\\r\\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was\\r\\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\nher intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to\\r\\ndine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\\r\\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\\r\\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.  I have not\\r\\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed\\r\\nthat you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\nThey then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\ndine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\ntable, she did not think any thing less than two courses could\\r\\nbe good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs,\\r\\nor satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54\\r\\n\\r\\nAS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover\\r\\nher spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption\\r\\non those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nbehaviour astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\\r\\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\\r\\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,\\r\\nwhy come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\\r\\nTeazing, teazing, man!  I will think no more about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by\\r\\nthe approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\\r\\nlook, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors,\\r\\nthan Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\nperfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\nembarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on\\r\\nTuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,\\r\\nwe meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much\\r\\nin love with you as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the\\r\\nhappy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness\\r\\nof Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;\\r\\nand the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of\\r\\ntheir punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When\\r\\nthey repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to\\r\\nsee whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their\\r\\nformer parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her\\r\\nprudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite\\r\\nhim to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to\\r\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to\\r\\nsmile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\nfriend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\\r\\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\nshewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\nformerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\nJane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\\r\\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet\\r\\nreceived pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her\\r\\nall the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\r\\nno cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as\\r\\nthe table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.\\r\\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\\r\\neither, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near\\r\\nenough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how\\r\\nseldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was\\r\\ntheir manner whenever they did.  Her mother\\'s ungraciousness,\\r\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any\\r\\nthing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was\\r\\nneither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would\\r\\nnot pass away without enabling them to enter into something\\r\\nmore of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation\\r\\nattending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which\\r\\npassed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was\\r\\nwearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\r\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\r\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give\\r\\nhim up for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\\r\\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded\\r\\nround the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and\\r\\nElizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy\\r\\nthat there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit\\r\\nof a chair.  And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the\\r\\ngirls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined.  We want\\r\\nnone of them; do we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She\\r\\nfollowed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke,\\r\\nhad scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and\\r\\nthen was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish\\r\\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the\\r\\nsex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\nproposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent\\r\\nto their feelings!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to\\r\\nScarborough, these three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\nconverse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by\\r\\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on\\r\\nthe young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,\\r\\nthe ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon\\r\\njoined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him\\r\\nfall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and\\r\\nin a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She\\r\\nnow lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for\\r\\nthe evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,\\r\\nbut that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the\\r\\nroom, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen\\r\\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any\\r\\nof the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\\r\\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day?  I think every thing has\\r\\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as\\r\\nwell dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a\\r\\nturn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The\\r\\nsoup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\\'\\r\\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\r\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three\\r\\nFrench cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look\\r\\nin greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her\\r\\nwhether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides?\\r\\n``Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\'\\'\\r\\nShe did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as\\r\\never lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and\\r\\nnot at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\nenough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\nwould get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\nfamily, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\nshe was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the\\r\\nnext day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable\\r\\none with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It\\r\\nmortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy\\r\\nhis conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,\\r\\nwithout having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,\\r\\nfrom what his manners now are, that he never had any design\\r\\nof engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed\\r\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of\\r\\ngenerally pleasing, than any other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\\r\\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\nacknowledge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all\\r\\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\nknowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do\\r\\nnot make me your confidante.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 55\\r\\n\\r\\nA FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and\\r\\nalone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but\\r\\nwas to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an\\r\\nhour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited\\r\\nhim to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,\\r\\nhe confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\\r\\nlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if\\r\\nshe would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\nwaiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\ninvitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none\\r\\nof them dressed.  In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in\\r\\nher dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come --\\r\\nMr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste.\\r\\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on\\r\\nwith her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say\\r\\nKitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs\\r\\nhalf an hour ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick,\\r\\nbe quick!  Where is your sash, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\ngo down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again\\r\\nin the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library,\\r\\nas was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.\\r\\nTwo obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, without making any impression on them.\\r\\nElizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,\\r\\nshe very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma?  What do\\r\\nyou keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you.\"  She then sat\\r\\nstill five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\noccasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here,\\r\\nmy love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\\r\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her\\r\\ndistress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she\\r\\nwould not give in to it.  In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nhalf-opened the door and called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her\\r\\nmother, as soon as she was in the hall.  \"Kitty and I are going\\r\\nup stairs to sit in my dressing room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but\\r\\nremained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\\r\\nsight, then returned into the drawing room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley\\r\\nwas every thing that was charming, except the professed lover\\r\\nof her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a\\r\\nmost agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore\\r\\nwith the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all\\r\\nher silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance\\r\\nparticularly grateful to the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\nwent away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own\\r\\nand Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot\\r\\nwith her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\\r\\nNot a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\\r\\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\\r\\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the\\r\\nstated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded\\r\\nthat all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s\\r\\nconcurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\nspent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter\\r\\nwas much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was\\r\\nnothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke\\r\\nhis ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\ncommunicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\nhim.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\nevening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\nbody away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a\\r\\nletter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose\\r\\nsoon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to\\r\\ncards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s\\r\\nschemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was\\r\\nfinished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was\\r\\nreason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for\\r\\nher.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and\\r\\nBingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\r\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the\\r\\nfaces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away\\r\\nfrom each other, would have told it all.  Their situation\\r\\nwas awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse.\\r\\nNot a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on\\r\\nthe point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as\\r\\nthe other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\r\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\nwould give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\nwith the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature\\r\\nin the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much.  I do not\\r\\ndeserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every\\r\\nsentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\\r\\nBut she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say\\r\\nhalf that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried.  \"I would not on\\r\\nany account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow\\r\\nher to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my\\r\\nfather already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate\\r\\nwill give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I\\r\\nbear so much happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken\\r\\nup the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\nand ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had\\r\\ngiven them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\r\\ncircumspection!  of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference\\r\\nwith her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment,\\r\\nI dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\nwishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and\\r\\nheartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their\\r\\nrelationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and\\r\\nthen, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he\\r\\nhad to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections;\\r\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed\\r\\nall his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded,\\r\\nbecause they had for basis the excellent understanding, and\\r\\nsuper-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity\\r\\nof feeling and taste between her and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\nsatisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\nin terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\nto Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.\\r\\nBennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly\\r\\nshewed how really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\ntheir visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\ngoodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure\\r\\nin thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt\\r\\nof your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means\\r\\nunlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will\\r\\never be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat\\r\\nyou; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\nwould be unpardonable in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife,\\r\\n\"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a\\r\\nyear, and very likely more.\"  Then addressing her daughter,\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan\\'t\\r\\nget a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nalways said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not\\r\\nbe so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw\\r\\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought\\r\\nhow likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is\\r\\nthe handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.  Jane was beyond\\r\\ncompetition her favourite child.  At that moment, she cared\\r\\nfor no other.  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest\\r\\nwith her for objects of happiness which she might in future be\\r\\nable to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\nKitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him\\r\\nan invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\\r\\naccept.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to\\r\\nbestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably\\r\\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\\r\\nsometimes occur.  In the absence of Jane, he always attached\\r\\nhimself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\r\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means\\r\\nof relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling\\r\\nme that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last\\r\\nspring!  I had not believed it possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But how did he\\r\\naccount for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing.  They were certainly no\\r\\nfriends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\nsince he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\nrespects.  But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\nbrother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and\\r\\nwe shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we\\r\\nonce were to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\\r\\nI ever heard you utter.  Good girl!  It would vex me, indeed,\\r\\nto see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\nNovember, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\nmy being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\\r\\nof his modesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\nqualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not\\r\\nbetrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had\\r\\nthe most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\\r\\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\"\\r\\ncried Jane.  \"Oh!  Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family,\\r\\nand blessed above them all!  If I could but see you as happy!\\r\\nIf there were but such another man for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so\\r\\nhappy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your goodness,\\r\\nI never can have your happiness.  No, no, let me shift for\\r\\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\\r\\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\nlong a secret.  Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to\\r\\nMrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do\\r\\nthe same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family\\r\\nin the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had\\r\\nfirst run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out\\r\\nfor misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56\\r\\n\\r\\nONE morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with\\r\\nJane had been formed, as he and the females of the family\\r\\nwere sitting together in the dining room, their attention\\r\\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;\\r\\nand they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\\r\\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\r\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\\r\\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\\r\\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it\\r\\nwas certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley\\r\\ninstantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of\\r\\nsuch an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\\r\\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\r\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was\\r\\nthrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine\\r\\nde Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\\r\\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight\\r\\ninclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\\r\\nladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\\r\\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost\\r\\npoliteness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said\\r\\nvery stiffly to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose,\\r\\nis your mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  \"She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of\\r\\nall is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the\\r\\ngrounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon\\r\\nbecome a part of the family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine\\r\\nafter a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;\\r\\nbut I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\nin summer; the windows are full west.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\nand then added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you\\r\\nleft Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\\r\\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\\r\\nher calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely\\r\\npuzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\nsome refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\nvery politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up,\\r\\nsaid to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\nwilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take\\r\\na turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about\\r\\nthe different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the\\r\\nhermitage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her\\r\\nparasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed\\r\\nthrough the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\\r\\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a\\r\\nshort survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\nwaiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\ngravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\nmake no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\nthan usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she\\r\\nlooked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\nfollowing manner: --\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason\\r\\nof my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,\\r\\nmust tell you why I come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able\\r\\nto account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\\r\\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however\\r\\ninsincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\\r\\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\\r\\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming\\r\\nnature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your\\r\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\\r\\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all\\r\\nlikelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own\\r\\nnephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I know it must be a scandalous\\r\\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\nthe truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off\\r\\nfor this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the\\r\\ntrouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\ncontradicted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not\\r\\nbeen industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know\\r\\nthat such a report is spread abroad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\\r\\nfor it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\\r\\nladyship.  You may ask questions which I shall not\\r\\nchoose to answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\nsatisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\nhis reason.  But your arts and allurements may, in a moment\\r\\nof infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\\r\\nand to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed\\r\\nto such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he\\r\\nhas in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest\\r\\nconcerns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\\r\\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have\\r\\nthe presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never.\\r\\nMr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.  Now what have you to\\r\\nsay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\nhe will make an offer to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their\\r\\ninfancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the\\r\\nfavourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s.  While in\\r\\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\\r\\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\nmarriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,\\r\\nof no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the\\r\\nfamily!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\\r\\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to\\r\\nevery feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard\\r\\nme say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\\r\\ncousin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If\\r\\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and\\r\\naunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much\\r\\nas you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended\\r\\non others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\nconfined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\\r\\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed\\r\\nby his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\ninclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\ndespised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will\\r\\nbe a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\\r\\nof us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But the\\r\\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of\\r\\nhappiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she\\r\\ncould, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this\\r\\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is\\r\\nnothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to\\r\\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined\\r\\nresolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded\\r\\nfrom it.  I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims.\\r\\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more\\r\\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter\\r\\nand my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended,\\r\\non the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the\\r\\nfather\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient -- though\\r\\nuntitled -- families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\\r\\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member\\r\\nof their respective houses; and what is to divide them?  The\\r\\nupstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\r\\nconnections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it\\r\\nmust not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own\\r\\ngood, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you\\r\\nhave been brought up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\nquitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s\\r\\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  You are a gentleman\\'s daughter.  But who was your\\r\\nmother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me\\r\\nignorant of their condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your\\r\\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging\\r\\nLady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but\\r\\nsay, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\nengagement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a\\r\\nmore reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into\\r\\na belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you\\r\\nhave given me the assurance I require.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be\\r\\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your\\r\\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\\r\\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at\\r\\nall more probable?  Supposing him to be attached to me,\\r\\nwould my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow\\r\\nit on his cousin?  Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the\\r\\narguments with which you have supported this extraordinary\\r\\napplication have been as frivolous as the application was\\r\\nill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my character, if you\\r\\nthink I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\r\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in\\r\\nhis affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no\\r\\nright to concern yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore,\\r\\nto be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.\\r\\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still\\r\\nanother to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your\\r\\nyoungest sister\\'s infamous elopement.  I know it all; that\\r\\nthe young man\\'s marrying her was a patched-up business, at\\r\\nthe expence of your father and uncles.  And is such a girl\\r\\nto be my nephew\\'s sister?  Is her husband, is the son of\\r\\nhis late father\\'s steward, to be his brother?  Heaven and\\r\\nearth! -- of what are you thinking?  Are the shades of\\r\\nPemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully\\r\\nanswered.  \"You have insulted me in every possible method.\\r\\nI must beg to return to the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\nturned back.  Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\nnephew!  Unfeeling, selfish girl!  Do you not consider that\\r\\na connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\\r\\neverybody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.  You know my\\r\\nsentiments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\nmanner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\nwithout reference to you, or to any person so wholly\\r\\nunconnected with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to\\r\\nobey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are\\r\\ndetermined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\\r\\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n\"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No\\r\\nprinciple of either would be violated by my marriage with\\r\\nMr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or\\r\\nthe indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his\\r\\nmarrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern -- and\\r\\nthe world in general would have too much sense to join in the\\r\\nscorn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve!\\r\\nVery well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss\\r\\nBennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to\\r\\ntry you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it,\\r\\nI will carry my point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\ndoor of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,\\r\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to\\r\\nyour mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most\\r\\nseriously displeased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade\\r\\nher ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\nherself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\nstairs.  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\ndressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in\\r\\nagain and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman!  and her calling here was\\r\\nprodigiously civil!  for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\\r\\nthe Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare\\r\\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well\\r\\ncall on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to\\r\\nyou, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\\r\\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit\\r\\nthrew Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could\\r\\nshe, for many hours, learn to think of it less than\\r\\nincessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken\\r\\nthe trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose\\r\\nof breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was\\r\\na rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of\\r\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\\r\\nimagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate\\r\\nfriend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was\\r\\nenough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made\\r\\nevery body eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not\\r\\nherself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must\\r\\nbring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at\\r\\nLucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with\\r\\nthe Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\\r\\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and\\r\\nimmediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\\r\\nsome future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could\\r\\nnot help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence\\r\\nof her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said\\r\\nof her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\nElizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\nand how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\nattached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\\r\\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or\\r\\nhis dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\r\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could\\r\\ndo; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a\\r\\nmarriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal\\r\\nto his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\\r\\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the\\r\\narguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,\\r\\ncontained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\\r\\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a\\r\\nrelation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\nbe as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that\\r\\ncase he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in\\r\\nher way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming\\r\\nagain to Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should\\r\\ncome to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall\\r\\nknow how to understand it.  I shall then give over every\\r\\nexpectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied\\r\\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\\r\\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\nvisitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much\\r\\nteazing on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by\\r\\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he\\r\\nhad to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being\\r\\nin some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly\\r\\nstruck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she\\r\\nanticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\ndown.  He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\nexceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\nknow its contents.  I did not know before, that I had two\\r\\ndaughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you\\r\\non a very important conquest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the\\r\\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to\\r\\nbe pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\\r\\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\ncontinued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in\\r\\nsuch matters as these; but I think I may defy even your\\r\\nsagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.  This letter\\r\\nis from Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Mr. Collins!  and what can he have to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins\\r\\nwith congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\ndaughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your\\r\\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What\\r\\nrelates to yourself, is as follows.\"  \"Having thus offered\\r\\nyou the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\r\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject\\r\\nof another; of which we have been advertised by the same\\r\\nauthority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not\\r\\nlong bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\\r\\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\\r\\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\\r\\npersonages in this land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"  \"This\\r\\nyoung gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing\\r\\nthe heart of mortal can most desire, -- splendid property,\\r\\nnoble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all\\r\\nthese temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and\\r\\nyourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\\r\\nwith this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be\\r\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it\\r\\ncomes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to\\r\\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look\\r\\non the match with a friendly eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I\\r\\nhave surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\\r\\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name\\r\\nwould have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,\\r\\nand who probably never looked at you in his life!  It is\\r\\nadmirable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could\\r\\nonly force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been\\r\\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  yes.  Pray read on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\nbecome apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\nthe part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\nshe termed so disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to\\r\\ngive the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\r\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and\\r\\nnot run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly\\r\\nsanctioned.\"  \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced\\r\\nthat my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up,\\r\\nand am only concerned that their living together before the\\r\\nmarriage took place should be so generally known.  I must not,\\r\\nhowever, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from\\r\\ndeclaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\r\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an\\r\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn,\\r\\nI should very strenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly\\r\\nto forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your\\r\\nsight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\"\\r\\n\"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of\\r\\nhis letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and\\r\\nhis expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look\\r\\nas if you did not enjoy it.  You are not going to be Missish,\\r\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For\\r\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and\\r\\nlaugh at them in our turn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted.  But it is\\r\\nso strange!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes -- that is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on\\r\\nany other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect\\r\\nindifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so\\r\\ndelightfully absurd!  Much as I abominate writing, I would not\\r\\ngive up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration.\\r\\nNay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\\r\\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\r\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.  And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady\\r\\nCatherine about this report?  Did she call to refuse her\\r\\nconsent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and\\r\\nas it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\ndistressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been\\r\\nmore at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\\r\\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\\r\\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder\\r\\nat such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\r\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\nas Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\nbring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\nafter Lady Catherine\\'s visit.  The gentlemen arrived early;\\r\\nand, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having\\r\\nseen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,\\r\\nBingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all\\r\\nwalking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\r\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the\\r\\nremaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however,\\r\\nsoon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind,\\r\\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\\r\\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of\\r\\nhim to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate\\r\\nresolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\nupon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\ngeneral concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with\\r\\nhim alone.  Now was the moment for her resolution to be\\r\\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\ngiving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\nwounding your\\'s.  I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\nunexampled kindness to my poor sister.  Ever since I have known\\r\\nit, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how\\r\\ngratefully I feel it.  Were it known to the rest of my family,\\r\\nI should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what\\r\\nmay, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.  I did not\\r\\nthink Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first\\r\\nbetrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and,\\r\\nof course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.  Let\\r\\nme thank you again and again, in the name of all my family,\\r\\nfor that generous compassion which induced you to take so much\\r\\ntrouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of\\r\\ndiscovering them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\\r\\nalone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\\r\\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\\r\\nattempt to deny.  But your family owe me nothing.  Much as\\r\\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.  After a\\r\\nshort pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\\r\\ntrifle with me.  If your feelings are still what they were\\r\\nlast April, tell me so at once.  My affections and wishes\\r\\nare unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\\r\\nsubject for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\nanxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\nimmediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\nthat her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since\\r\\nthe period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with\\r\\ngratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness\\r\\nwhich this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\r\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as\\r\\nsensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be\\r\\nsupposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his\\r\\neye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt\\r\\ndelight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she\\r\\ncould not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings,\\r\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\r\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was\\r\\ntoo much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\\r\\nany other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted\\r\\nfor their present good understanding to the efforts of his\\r\\naunt, who did call on him in her return through London,\\r\\nand there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and\\r\\nthe substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling\\r\\nemphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her\\r\\nladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness\\r\\nand assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist\\r\\nher endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which\\r\\nshe had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship,\\r\\nits effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever\\r\\nallowed myself to hope before.  I knew enough of your\\r\\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\\r\\nirrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged\\r\\nit to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know\\r\\nenough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.\\r\\nAfter abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no\\r\\nscruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?  For, though\\r\\nyour accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises,\\r\\nmy behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest\\r\\nreproof.  It was unpardonable.  I cannot think of it without\\r\\nabhorrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\nthat evening,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The conduct of neither, if\\r\\nstrictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\nhave both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.  The recollection\\r\\nof what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\nduring the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\ninexpressibly painful to me.  Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\nshall never forget: ``had you behaved in a more gentleman-like\\r\\nmanner.\\'\\' Those were your words.  You know not, you can\\r\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; -- though it was\\r\\nsome time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow\\r\\ntheir justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\nan impression.  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\nfelt in such a way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid of\\r\\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of your\\r\\ncountenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could\\r\\nnot have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\\r\\nyou to accept me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections\\r\\nwill not do at all.  I assure you that I have long been most\\r\\nheartily ashamed of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy mentioned his letter.  \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\\r\\nmake you think better of me?  Did you, on reading it, give any\\r\\ncredit to its contents?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\\r\\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\\r\\nbut it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed the letter.\\r\\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\\r\\nshould dread your having the power of reading again.  I can\\r\\nremember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\\r\\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have\\r\\nboth reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they\\r\\nare not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself\\r\\nperfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\nwritten in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\\r\\nso.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the\\r\\nletter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person\\r\\nwho received it, are now so widely different from what they\\r\\nwere then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it\\r\\nought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy.\\r\\nThink only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\\r\\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\\r\\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\\r\\nwhat is much better, of innocence.  But with me, it is not\\r\\nso.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which\\r\\nought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my\\r\\nlife, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was\\r\\ntaught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my\\r\\ntemper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them\\r\\nin pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many\\r\\nyears an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though\\r\\ngood themselves (my father, particularly, all that was\\r\\nbenevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me\\r\\nto be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\\r\\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\\r\\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth\\r\\ncompared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and\\r\\ntwenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\\r\\nloveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a\\r\\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you,\\r\\nI was properly humbled.  I came to you without a doubt of my\\r\\nreception.  You shewed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?  I believed\\r\\nyou to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally,\\r\\nI assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits\\r\\nmight often lead me wrong.  How you must have hated me after\\r\\nthat evening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hate you!  I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\\r\\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we\\r\\nmet at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being\\r\\nnoticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved no\\r\\nextraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect\\r\\nto receive more than my due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every\\r\\ncivility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\npast; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your\\r\\nill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been\\r\\nattended to.  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves\\r\\nI can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after\\r\\nI had seen you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance,\\r\\nand of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which\\r\\nnaturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon\\r\\nlearnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in\\r\\nquest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn,\\r\\nand that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from\\r\\nno other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\nto know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining\\r\\ntheir watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder\\r\\nwhich introduced the discussion of their affairs.  Darcy\\r\\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given\\r\\nhim the earliest information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would soon\\r\\nhappen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission.  I guessed as\\r\\nmuch.\"  And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it\\r\\nhad been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\r\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long\\r\\nago.  I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\ninterference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.  His\\r\\nsurprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion.\\r\\nI told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\\r\\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\\r\\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\\r\\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\\r\\ndirecting his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when\\r\\nyou told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my\\r\\ninformation last spring?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\nvisits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\naffection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\nconviction to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His diffidence\\r\\nhad prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a\\r\\ncase, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.  I was\\r\\nobliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not\\r\\nunjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal\\r\\nthat your sister had been in town three months last winter,\\r\\nthat I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was\\r\\nangry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than\\r\\nhe remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments.  He has\\r\\nheartily forgiven me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\ndelightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\ninvaluable; but she checked herself.  She remembered that he\\r\\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early\\r\\nto begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\\r\\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\\r\\nconversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they\\r\\nparted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a\\r\\nquestion which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\nentered their room, and from all the others when they sat down\\r\\nto table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\nabout, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as\\r\\nshe spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a\\r\\nsuspicion of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing\\r\\nextraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the\\r\\nunacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in\\r\\nwhich happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and\\r\\nconfused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself\\r\\nto be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were\\r\\nother evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in\\r\\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that\\r\\nno one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others\\r\\nit was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence\\r\\nmight do away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was\\r\\nvery far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\nincredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be! -- engaged to\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it\\r\\nto be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was\\r\\non you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do\\r\\nnot.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the\\r\\ntruth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at her doubtingly.  \"Oh, Lizzy!  it cannot be.\\r\\nI know how much you dislike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know nothing of the matter.  That is all to be forgot.\\r\\nPerhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in\\r\\nsuch cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is\\r\\nthe last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and\\r\\nmore seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe\\r\\nyou,\" cried Jane.  \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would -- I do\\r\\ncongratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question\\r\\n-- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us\\r\\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\\r\\nBut are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have such a\\r\\nbrother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or\\r\\nmyself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\nimpossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?\\r\\nOh, Lizzy!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.\\r\\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel more than I ought to\\r\\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\\r\\nI am afraid you will be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest sister, now be serious.  I want to talk very\\r\\nseriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\ndelay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\nbegan.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\nbeautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced\\r\\nthe desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\nassurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\nBennet had nothing farther to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as\\r\\nmyself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but\\r\\nhis love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\nBingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley\\r\\nand yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very\\r\\nsly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what\\r\\npassed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it\\r\\nto another, not to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been\\r\\nunwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her\\r\\nown feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\\r\\nBut now she would no longer conceal from her his share in\\r\\nLydia\\'s marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night\\r\\nspent in conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window\\r\\nthe next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming\\r\\nhere again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so\\r\\ntiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he\\r\\nwould go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\nwith his company.  What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must\\r\\nwalk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\\r\\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\\r\\nalways giving him such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\nand shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\ninformation; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\nhave you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her\\r\\nway again to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk,\\r\\nand Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but\\r\\nI am sure it will be too much for Kitty.  Won\\'t it, Kitty?\"\\r\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home.  Darcy professed\\r\\na great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth\\r\\nsilently consented.  As she went up stairs to get ready,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have\\r\\nthat disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not\\r\\nmind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no\\r\\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do\\r\\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent\\r\\nshould be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth\\r\\nreserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s.  She\\r\\ncould not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes\\r\\ndoubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough\\r\\nto overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were\\r\\nviolently set against the match, or violently delighted with\\r\\nit, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted\\r\\nto do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that\\r\\nMr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the\\r\\nfirst vehemence of her disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\nshe saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation\\r\\non seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father\\'s\\r\\nopposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it\\r\\nshould be through her means -- that she, his favourite child,\\r\\nshould be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him\\r\\nwith fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched\\r\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared\\r\\nagain, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his\\r\\nsmile.  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was\\r\\nsitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work\\r\\nsaid in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the\\r\\nlibrary.\"  She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and\\r\\nanxious.  \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing?  Are you out\\r\\nof your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always\\r\\nhated him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had\\r\\nbeen more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would\\r\\nhave spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\nexceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and\\r\\nshe assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to\\r\\nMr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is\\r\\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\\r\\ncarriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\\r\\nbelief of my indifference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all.  We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort\\r\\nof man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes,\\r\\n\"I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is perfectly\\r\\namiable.  You do not know what he really is; then pray do not\\r\\npain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent.\\r\\nHe is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare\\r\\nrefuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it\\r\\nto you, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise\\r\\nyou to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy.\\r\\nI know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless\\r\\nyou truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him\\r\\nas a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the\\r\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely\\r\\nescape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the\\r\\ngrief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.\\r\\nYou know not what you are about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\nreply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\nreally the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual\\r\\nchange which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her\\r\\nabsolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a\\r\\nday, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and\\r\\nenumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer\\r\\nher father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no\\r\\nmore to say.  If this be the case, he deserves you.  I could\\r\\nnot have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what\\r\\nMr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.  He heard her with\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!  And so, Darcy did\\r\\nevery thing: made up the match, gave the money, paid the\\r\\nfellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission!  So much the\\r\\nbetter.  It will save me a world of trouble and economy.\\r\\nHad it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid\\r\\nhim; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their\\r\\nown way.  I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant\\r\\nand storm about his love for you, and there will be an end\\r\\nof the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\nreading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\ntime, allowed her at last to go -- saying, as she quitted the\\r\\nroom, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in,\\r\\nfor I am quite at leisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight;\\r\\nand, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room,\\r\\nshe was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\\r\\nEvery thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed\\r\\ntranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to\\r\\nbe dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would\\r\\ncome in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\nfollowed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect\\r\\nwas most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it\\r\\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she\\r\\nheard; though not in general backward to credit what was for\\r\\nthe advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\r\\nlover to any of them.  She began at length to recover, to\\r\\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,\\r\\nand bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Lord bless me!  only think!  dear me!\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  Who would have thought it!  And is it really true?\\r\\nOh!  my sweetest Lizzy!  how rich and how great you will be!\\r\\nWhat pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\\r\\nJane\\'s is nothing to it -- nothing at all.  I am so pleased --\\r\\nso happy.  Such a charming man! -- so handsome!  so tall! --\\r\\nOh, my dear Lizzy!  pray apologise for my having disliked him\\r\\nso much before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear Lizzy.\\r\\nA house in town!  Every thing that is charming!  Three\\r\\ndaughters married!  Ten thousand a year!  Oh, Lord!  What will\\r\\nbecome of me.  I shall go distracted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\ndoubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was\\r\\nheard only by herself, soon went away.  But before she had\\r\\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!\\r\\nTen thousand a year, and very likely more!  \\'Tis as good as a\\r\\nLord!  And a special licence.  You must and shall be married\\r\\nby a special licence.  But my dearest love, tell me what dish\\r\\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it\\r\\ntomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the\\r\\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\nthe certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\nher relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\nfor.  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected;\\r\\nfor Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended\\r\\nson-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was\\r\\nin her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference\\r\\nfor his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\\r\\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured\\r\\nher that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall\\r\\nlike your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH\\'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she\\r\\nwanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love\\r\\nwith her.  \"How could you begin?\" said she.  \"I can comprehend\\r\\nyour going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning;\\r\\nbut what could set you off in the first place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\nwords, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.  I was\\r\\nin the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --\\r\\nmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the\\r\\nuncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to\\r\\ngive you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for\\r\\nmy impertinence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very\\r\\nlittle less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of\\r\\ndeference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the\\r\\nwomen who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for\\r\\nyour approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you,\\r\\nbecause I was so unlike them.  Had you not been really\\r\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the\\r\\npains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\\r\\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the\\r\\npersons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved\\r\\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\\r\\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be\\r\\nsure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of\\r\\nthat when they fall in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\nshe was ill at Netherfield?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest Jane!  who could have done less for her?  But make a\\r\\nvirtue of it by all means.  My good qualities are under your\\r\\nprotection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\nand, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing\\r\\nand quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\ndirectly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to\\r\\nthe point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first\\r\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you\\r\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\nencouragement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so was I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\nand that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!  But I\\r\\nwonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left\\r\\nto yourself.  I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had\\r\\nnot asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness\\r\\nto Lydia had certainly great effect.  Too much, I am\\r\\nafraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs\\r\\nfrom a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned\\r\\nthe subject.  This will never do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be perfectly\\r\\nfair.  Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\nwere the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted\\r\\nfor my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing\\r\\nyour gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening\\r\\nof your\\'s.  My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\ndetermined at once to know every thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make\\r\\nher happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell me, what did\\r\\nyou come down to Netherfield for?  Was it merely to ride to\\r\\nLongbourn and be embarrassed?  or had you intended any more\\r\\nserious consequence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My avowed one,\\r\\nor what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\nstill partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\\r\\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine\\r\\nwhat is to befall her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\\r\\nBut it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper,\\r\\nit shall be done directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\nonce did.  But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\nneglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with\\r\\nMr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet\\r\\nanswered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter; but now, having that\\r\\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was\\r\\nalmost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost\\r\\nthree days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought\\r\\nto have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\\r\\nYou supposed more than really existed.  But now suppose as\\r\\nmuch as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\nimagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\ngreatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again\\r\\nand again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly\\r\\nas to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will\\r\\ngo round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the\\r\\nworld.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one\\r\\nwith such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only\\r\\nsmiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world\\r\\nthat he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at\\r\\nChristmas.  Your\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\nand still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to\\r\\nMr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\nI must trouble you once more for congratulations.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwill soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.  Console Lady Catherine\\r\\nas well as you can.  But, if I were you, I would stand by the\\r\\nnephew.  He has more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his\\r\\napproaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\\r\\ninsincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\\r\\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\\r\\nJane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling\\r\\nno reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder\\r\\nanswer than she knew was deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\ninformation, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it.\\r\\nFour sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her\\r\\ndelight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\ncongratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn\\r\\nfamily heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas\\r\\nlodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\\r\\nLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by\\r\\nthe contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really\\r\\nrejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\\r\\nstorm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of\\r\\nher friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in\\r\\nthe course of their meetings she must sometimes think the\\r\\npleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all\\r\\nthe parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore\\r\\nit, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to\\r\\nSir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\r\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of\\r\\ntheir all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent\\r\\ncomposure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir\\r\\nWilliam was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,\\r\\ntax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as\\r\\nher sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\nfamiliarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet,\\r\\nwhenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her\\r\\nrespect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely\\r\\nto make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to\\r\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever\\r\\nanxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with\\r\\nwhom he might converse without mortification; and though the\\r\\nuncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\\r\\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\\r\\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time\\r\\nwhen they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\\r\\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\\r\\nat Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61\\r\\n\\r\\nHAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which\\r\\nMrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\r\\nWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,\\r\\nand talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,\\r\\nfor the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her\\r\\nearnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children\\r\\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\\r\\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\r\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\r\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally\\r\\nnervous and invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\\r\\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing\\r\\nelse could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially\\r\\nwhen he was least expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\\r\\ntwelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton\\r\\nrelations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her\\r\\naffectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then\\r\\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\\r\\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other\\r\\nsource of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\ntime with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to\\r\\nwhat she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She\\r\\nwas not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from\\r\\nthe influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper\\r\\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and\\r\\nless insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society\\r\\nshe was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\r\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\\r\\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never consent\\r\\nto her going.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\nnecessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was\\r\\nobliged to mix more with the world, but she could still\\r\\nmoralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer\\r\\nmortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her\\r\\nown, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to\\r\\nthe change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\\r\\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with\\r\\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become\\r\\nacquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood\\r\\nhad before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,\\r\\nwas not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed\\r\\non to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which\\r\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to\\r\\nher that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a\\r\\nhope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\ndear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to\\r\\nhave you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\nyou will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\ncourt very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\nenough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of\\r\\nabout three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak\\r\\nto Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty\\r\\nand expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it\\r\\nwas in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be\\r\\ncalled economy in her own private expences, she frequently\\r\\nsent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an\\r\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so\\r\\nextravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must\\r\\nbe very insufficient to their support; and whenever they\\r\\nchanged their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of\\r\\nbeing applied to for some little assistance towards discharging\\r\\ntheir bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration\\r\\nof peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\r\\nextreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest\\r\\nof a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\\r\\nHis affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted\\r\\na little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she\\r\\nretained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\\r\\ngiven her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.\\r\\nLydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\\r\\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys\\r\\nthey both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s\\r\\ngood humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk\\r\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but\\r\\nas she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\nPemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever\\r\\nof Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and\\r\\npaid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\nsisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were\\r\\nable to love each other even as well as they intended.\\r\\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\\r\\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment\\r\\nbordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking\\r\\nto her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a\\r\\nrespect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the\\r\\nobject of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which\\r\\nhad never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\ninstructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take\\r\\nliberties with her husband which a brother will not always\\r\\nallow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\nnephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\ncharacter in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\narrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially\\r\\nof Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\\r\\nBut at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on\\r\\nto overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after\\r\\na little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\r\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her\\r\\ncuriosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she\\r\\ncondescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that\\r\\npollution which its woods had received, not merely from the\\r\\npresence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and\\r\\naunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\\r\\nterms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and\\r\\nthey were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards\\r\\nthe persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the\\r\\nmeans of uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

J. PARKHILL & CO., BOSTON, U. S. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE recent cult for Miss Austen, which has resulted in no less than ten\\r\\nnew editions of her novels within a decade and three memoirs by\\r\\ndifferent hands within as many years, have made the facts of her life\\r\\nfamiliar to most readers. It was a short life, and an uneventful one as\\r\\nviewed from the standpoint of our modern times, when steam and\\r\\nelectricity have linked together the ends of the earth, and the very air\\r\\nseems teeming with news, agitations, discussions. We have barely time to\\r\\nrecover our breath between post and post; and the morning paper with its\\r\\nstatements of disaster and its hints of still greater evils to be, is\\r\\nscarcely out-lived, when, lo! in comes the evening issue, contradicting\\r\\nthe news of the morning, to be sure, but full of omens and auguries of\\r\\nits own to strew our pillows with the seed of wakefulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo us, publications come hot and hot from the press. Telegraphic wires\\r\\nlike the intricate and incalculable zigzags of the lightning ramify\\r\\nabove our heads; and who can tell at what moment their darts may\\r\\nstrike? In Miss Austen\\'s day the tranquil, drowsy, decorous English day\\r\\nof a century since, all was different. News travelled then from hand to\\r\\nhand, carried in creaking post-wagons, or in cases of extreme urgency by\\r\\nmen on horseback. When a gentleman journeying in his own \"chaise\" took\\r\\nthree days in going from Exeter to London, a distance now covered in\\r\\nthree hours of railroad, there was little chance of frequent surprises.\\r\\nLove, sorrow, and death were in the world then as now, and worked their\\r\\nwill upon the sons of men; but people did not expect happenings every\\r\\nday or even every year. No doubt they lived the longer for this\\r\\nexemption from excitement, and kept their nerves in a state of wholesome\\r\\nrepair; but it goes without saying that the events of which they knew so\\r\\nlittle did not stir them deeply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Austen\\'s life coincided with two of the momentous epochs of\\r\\nhistory,--the American struggle for independence, and the French\\r\\nRevolution; but there is scarcely an allusion to either in her letters.\\r\\nShe was interested in the fleet and its victories because two of her\\r\\nbrothers were in the navy and had promotion and prize-money to look\\r\\nforward to. In this connection she mentions Trafalgar and the Egyptian\\r\\nexpedition, and generously remarks that she would read Southey\\'s \"Life\\r\\nof Nelson\" if there was anything in it about her brother Frank! She\\r\\nhonors Sir John Moore by remarking after his death that his mother\\r\\nwould perhaps have preferred to have him less distinguished and still\\r\\nalive; further than that, the making of the gooseberry jam and a good\\r\\nrecipe for orange wine interests her more than all the marchings and\\r\\ncountermarchings, the manoeuvres and diplomacies, going on the world\\r\\nover. In the midst of the universal vortex of fear and hope, triumph and\\r\\ndefeat, while the fate of Britain and British liberty hung trembling in\\r\\nthe balance, she sits writing her letters, trimming her caps, and\\r\\ndiscussing small beer with her sister in a lively and unruffled fashion\\r\\nwonderful to contemplate. \"The society of rural England in those days,\"\\r\\nas Mr. Goldwin Smith happily puts it, \"enjoyed a calm of its own in the\\r\\nmidst of the European tempest like the windless centre of a circular\\r\\nstorm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point of view of a woman with such an environment must naturally be\\r\\ncircumscribed and narrow; and in this Miss Austen\\'s charm consists.\\r\\nSeeing little, she painted what she saw with absolute fidelity and a\\r\\ndexterity and perfection unequalled. \"On her was bestowed, though in a\\r\\nhumble form, the gift which had been bestowed on Homer, Shakespeare,\\r\\nCervantes, Scott, and a few others,--the gift of creative power.\"\\r\\nEndowed with the keenest and most delicate insight and a vivid sense of\\r\\nhumor, she depicted with exactitude what she observed and what she\\r\\nunderstood, giving to each fact and emotion its precise shade and\\r\\nvalue. The things she did not see she did not attempt. Affectation was\\r\\nimpossible to her,--most of all, affectation of knowledge or feeling not\\r\\njustly her own. \"She held the mirror up to her time\" with an exquisite\\r\\nsincerity and fidelity; and the closeness of her study brought her\\r\\nintimately near to those hidden springs which underlie all human nature.\\r\\nThis is the reason why, for all their skimp skirts, leg-of-mutton\\r\\nsleeves, and bygone impossible bonnets, her characters do not seem to us\\r\\nold-fashioned. Minds and hearts are made pretty much after the same\\r\\npattern from century to century; and given a modern dress and speech,\\r\\nEmma or Elizabeth or dear Anne Eliot could enter a drawing-room to-day,\\r\\nand excite no surprise except by so closely resembling the people whom\\r\\nthey would find there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Austen\\'s novels are dateless things,\" Mr. Augustine Birrell tells\\r\\nus. \"Nobody in his senses would speak of them as \\'old novels.\\' \\'John\\r\\nInglesant\\' is an old novel, so is \\'Ginx\\'s Baby.\\' But Emma is quite new,\\r\\nand, like a wise woman, affords few clues to her age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe allude with a special touch of affection to Anne Eliot. \"Persuasion,\"\\r\\nwhich was written during the last two years of Miss Austen\\'s life, when\\r\\nthe refining touch of Eternity was already upon her, has always seemed\\r\\nto us the most perfect of her novels; and Anne, with her exquisite\\r\\nbreeding and unselfish straightforwardness, just touched with the tender\\r\\nreserve of memory and regret, one of her best portraitures. But this is\\r\\na matter of individual taste. Doubtless Elizabeth Bennet is \"better fun\"\\r\\nas the modern girl would say. Miss Austen herself preferred her. She had\\r\\na droll and pretty way of talking about her characters which showed how\\r\\nreal they were to her own mind, and made them equally real to other\\r\\npeople. In 1813 she had the good luck to light upon a portrait of Jane\\r\\nBennet at an exhibition.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \"I was very well pleased (pray tell Fanny) with a\\r\\n      small portrait of Mrs. Bingley, excessively like her.\\r\\n      I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there\\r\\n      was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps I may find her in the great\\r\\n      exhibition, which we shall go to if we have time. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bingley\\'s is exactly like herself,--size, shaped face,\\r\\n      features and sweetness; there never was a greater\\r\\n      likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green\\r\\n      ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\\r\\n      supposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I\\r\\n      dare say Mrs. D. will be in yellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd later:--\\r\\n\\r\\n      \"We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\\r\\n      Reynolds\\'; and I am disappointed, for there was\\r\\n      nothing like Mrs. D. at either. I can only imagine\\r\\n      that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too much to like\\r\\n      it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine\\r\\n      he would have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of\\r\\n      love, pride, and delicacy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letters included in this series comprise about three quarters of the\\r\\ncollection in two volumes published in 1884 by her great-nephew Lord\\r\\nBrabourne. The lightness, almost friskiness, of their tone cannot fail\\r\\nto strike the reader. Modern letters written by women are filled more or\\r\\nless with hints and queries; questionings as to the why and the\\r\\nwherefore occur; allusions to the various \"fads\" of the day, literary or\\r\\nartistic,--Ibsen, Tolstoi, Browning, Esoteric Buddhism, Wagner\\'s Music,\\r\\nthe Mind Cure, Social Science, Causes and Reforms. But Cowper and Crabbe\\r\\nwere the poetical sensations in Miss Austen\\'s time, Scott and Byron its\\r\\nphenomenal novelties; it took months to get most books printed, and\\r\\nyears to persuade anybody to read them. Furthermore the letters, in all\\r\\nprobability, are carefully chosen to reveal only the more superficial\\r\\nside of their writer. There are wide gaps of omission, covering\\r\\nimportant events such as Mr. Austen\\'s death, the long illness through\\r\\nwhich Jane nursed her brother Henry, and the anxieties and worries which\\r\\nhis failure in business caused to the whole family. What is vouchsafed\\r\\nus is a glimpse of the girlish and untroubled moments of Miss Austen\\'s\\r\\nlife; and the glimpse is a sweet and friendly one. We are glad to have\\r\\nit, in spite of our suspicion that another and even more interesting\\r\\npart of her personality is withheld from us.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good daughter, a delightful sister, the most perfect of aunts, what\\r\\nbetter record could there be of a single woman? Her literary work never\\r\\nstood in the way of her home duties, any more than her \"quiet, limpid,\\r\\nunimpassioned style\" stood between her thought and her readers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fame may justly be said to be almost entirely posthumous. She was\\r\\nread and praised to a moderate degree during her lifetime, but all her\\r\\nnovels together brought her no more than seven hundred pounds; and her\\r\\nreputation, as it were, was in its close-sheathed bud when, at the early\\r\\nage of forty-one, she died. It would have excited in her an amused\\r\\nincredulity, no doubt, had any one predicted that two generations after\\r\\nher death the real recognition of her powers was to come. Time, which\\r\\nlike desert sands has effaced the footprints of so many promising\\r\\nauthors, has, with her, served as the desert wind, to blow aside those\\r\\ndusts of the commonplace which for a while concealed her true\\r\\nproportions. She is loved more than she ever hoped to be, and far more\\r\\nwidely known. Mrs. Ritchie tells somewhere an anecdote of a party of\\r\\nseven assembled at a dinner-table, where the question arose of the\\r\\nlocality of one of Miss Austen\\'s places,--Maple Grove, the residence of\\r\\nMr. Suckling, if we are not mistaken,--and six of the persons present at\\r\\nonce recognized the allusion, and had a formed opinion on the subject.\\r\\nThe seventh was a Frenchman who did not read English!\\r\\n\\r\\nScott, Macaulay, Sir James Mackintosh, Miss Martineau, Mrs. Ritchie,\\r\\nMiss Mitford, and a host of others have vied in their generous tributes\\r\\nof admiration. But most striking of all, to our thinking, is that paid\\r\\nto Miss Austen by Lord Tennyson when, in some visit to Lyme not many\\r\\nyears since, those with him pointed out this and the other feature of\\r\\nthe place only to be interrupted with--\"Never mind all that. Show me the\\r\\nexact spot where Louisa Musgrove fell!\" Could non-historical\\r\\nverisimilitude go farther or mean more?\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                      S. C. W.\\r\\n\\r\\n  NEWPORT, June, 1892.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTERS OF JANE AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             STEVENTON, Thursday (January 16, 1796).\\r\\n\\r\\nI HAVE just received yours and Mary\\'s letter, and I thank you both,\\r\\nthough their contents might have been more agreeable. I do not at all\\r\\nexpect to see you on Tuesday, since matters have fallen out so\\r\\nunpleasantly; and if you are not able to return till after that day, it\\r\\nwill hardly be possible for us to send for you before Saturday, though\\r\\nfor my own part I care so little about the ball that it would be no\\r\\nsacrifice to me to give it up for the sake of seeing you two days\\r\\nearlier. We are extremely sorry for poor Eliza\\'s illness. I trust,\\r\\nhowever, that she has continued to recover since you wrote, and that you\\r\\nwill none of you be the worse for your attendance on her. What a\\r\\ngood-for-nothing fellow Charles is to bespeak the stockings! I hope he\\r\\nwill be too hot all the rest of his life for it!\\r\\n\\r\\nI sent you a letter yesterday to Ibthorp, which I suppose you will not\\r\\nreceive at Kintbury. It was not very long or very witty, and therefore\\r\\nif you never receive it, it does not much signify. I wrote principally\\r\\nto tell you that the Coopers were arrived and in good health. The little\\r\\nboy is very like Dr. Cooper, and the little girl is to resemble Jane,\\r\\nthey say.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur party to Ashe to-morrow night will consist of Edward Cooper, James\\r\\n(for a ball is nothing without him), Buller, who is now staying with us,\\r\\nand I. I look forward with great impatience to it, as I rather expect to\\r\\nreceive an offer from my friend in the course of the evening. I shall\\r\\nrefuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very much flattered by your commendation of my last letter, for I\\r\\nwrite only for fame, and without any view to pecuniary emolument.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward is gone to spend the day with his friend, John Lyford, and does\\r\\nnot return till to-morrow. Anna is now here; she came up in her chaise\\r\\nto spend the day with her young cousins, but she does not much take to\\r\\nthem or to anything about them, except Caroline\\'s spinning-wheel. I am\\r\\nvery glad to find from Mary that Mr. and Mrs. Fowle are pleased with\\r\\nyou. I hope you will continue to give satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow impertinent you are to write to me about Tom, as if I had not\\r\\nopportunities of hearing from him myself! The last letter that I\\r\\nreceived from him was dated on Friday, 8th, and he told me that if the\\r\\nwind should be favorable on Sunday, which it proved to be, they were to\\r\\nsail from Falmouth on that day. By this time, therefore, they are at\\r\\nBarbadoes, I suppose. The Rivers are still at Manydown, and are to be at\\r\\nAshe to-morrow. I intended to call on the Miss Biggs yesterday had the\\r\\nweather been tolerable. Caroline, Anna, and I have just been devouring\\r\\nsome cold souse, and it would be difficult to say which enjoyed it most.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell Mary that I make over Mr. Heartley and all his estate to her for\\r\\nher sole use and benefit in future, and not only him, but all my other\\r\\nadmirers into the bargain wherever she can find them, even the kiss\\r\\nwhich C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I mean to confine myself in\\r\\nfuture to Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don\\'t care sixpence. Assure her\\r\\nalso, as a last and indubitable proof of Warren\\'s indifference to me,\\r\\nthat he actually drew that gentleman\\'s picture for me, and delivered it\\r\\nto me without a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friday._--At length the day is come on which I am to flirt my last with\\r\\nTom Lefroy, and when you receive this it will be over. My tears flow as\\r\\nI write at the melancholy idea. Wm. Chute called here yesterday. I\\r\\nwonder what he means by being so civil. There is a report that Tom is\\r\\ngoing to be married to a Lichfield lass. John Lyford and his sister\\r\\nbring Edward home to-day, dine with us, and we shall all go together to\\r\\nAshe. I understand that we are to draw for partners. I shall be\\r\\nextremely impatient to hear from you again, that I may know how Eliza\\r\\nis, and when you are to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith best love, etc., I am affectionately yours,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                  J.

We reached\\r\\nStaines yesterday, I do not (know) when, without suffering so much from\\r\\nthe heat as I had hoped to do. We set off again this morning at seven\\r\\no\\'clock, and had a very pleasant drive, as the morning was cloudy and\\r\\nperfectly cool. I came all the way in the chaise from Hertford Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward[1] and Frank[2] are both gone out to seek their fortunes; the\\r\\nlatter is to return soon and help us seek ours. The former we shall\\r\\nnever see again. We are to be at Astley\\'s to-night, which I am glad of.\\r\\nEdward has heard from Henry this morning. He has not been at the races\\r\\nat all, unless his driving Miss Pearson over to Rowling one day can be\\r\\nso called. We shall find him there on Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you are all alive after our melancholy parting yesterday, and\\r\\nthat you pursued your intended avocation with success. God bless you! I\\r\\nmust leave off, for we are going out.\\r\\n\\r\\n                             Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                     J.

Let me know how\\r\\nmany, besides their fourteen selves and Mr. and Mrs. Wright, Michael\\r\\nwill contrive to place about their coach, and how many of the gentlemen,\\r\\nmusicians, and waiters he will have persuaded to come in their\\r\\nshooting-jackets. I hope John Lovett\\'s accident will not prevent his\\r\\nattending the ball, as you will otherwise be obliged to dance with Mr.\\r\\nTincton the whole evening. Let me know how J. Harwood deports himself\\r\\nwithout the Miss Biggs, and which of the Marys will carry the day with\\r\\nmy brother James.\\r\\n\\r\\n_We_ were at a ball on Saturday, I assure you. We dined at Goodnestone,\\r\\nand in the evening danced two country-dances and the Boulangeries. I\\r\\nopened the ball with Edward Bridges; the other couples were Lewis Cage\\r\\nand Harriet, Frank and Louisa, Fanny and George. Elizabeth played one\\r\\ncountry-dance, Lady Bridges the other, which she made Henry dance with\\r\\nher, and Miss Finch played the Boulangeries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reading over the last three or four lines, I am aware of my having\\r\\nexpressed myself in so doubtful a manner that if I did not tell you to\\r\\nthe contrary, you might imagine it was Lady Bridges who made Henry dance\\r\\nwith her at the same time that she was playing, which, if not\\r\\nimpossible, must appear a very improbable event to you. But it was\\r\\nElizabeth who danced. We supped there, and walked home at night under\\r\\nthe shade of two umbrellas.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day the Goodnestone party begins to disperse and spread itself\\r\\nabroad. Mr. and Mrs. Cage and George repair to Hythe. Lady Waltham, Miss\\r\\nBridges, and Miss Mary Finch to Dover, for the health of the two former.\\r\\nI have never seen Marianne at all. On Thursday Mr. and Mrs. Bridges\\r\\nreturn to Danbury; Miss Harriet Hales accompanies them to London on her\\r\\nway to Dorsetshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer Claringbould died this morning, and I fancy Edward means to get\\r\\nsome of his farm, if he can cheat Sir Brook enough in the agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have just got some venison from Godmersham, which the two Mr. Harveys\\r\\nare to dine on to-morrow, and on Friday or Saturday the Goodnestone\\r\\npeople are to finish their scraps. Henry went away on Friday, as he\\r\\npurposed, _without fayl_. You will hear from him soon, I imagine, as he\\r\\ntalked of writing to Steventon shortly. Mr. Richard Harvey is going to\\r\\nbe married; but as it is a great secret, and only known to half the\\r\\nneighborhood, you must not mention it. The lady\\'s name is Musgrave.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am in great distress. I cannot determine whether I shall give Richis\\r\\nhalf a guinea or only five shillings when I go away. Counsel me, amiable\\r\\nMiss Austen, and tell me which will be the most.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked Frank last night to Crixhall Ruff, and he appeared much\\r\\nedified. Little Edward was breeched yesterday for good and all, and was\\r\\nwhipped into the bargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPray remember me to everybody who does not inquire after me; those who\\r\\ndo, remember me without bidding. Give my love to Mary Harrison, and\\r\\ntell her I wish, whenever she is attached to a young man, some\\r\\nrespectable Dr. Marchmont may keep them apart for five volumes. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    ROWLING, Thursday (September 15).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--We have been very gay since I wrote last; dining at\\r\\nNackington, returning by moonlight, and everything quite in style, not\\r\\nto mention Mr. Claringbould\\'s funeral which we saw go by on Sunday. I\\r\\nbelieve I told you in a former letter that Edward had some idea of\\r\\ntaking the name of Claringbould; but that scheme is over, though it\\r\\nwould be a very eligible as well as a very pleasant plan, would any one\\r\\nadvance him money enough to begin on. We rather expected Mr. Milles to\\r\\nhave done so on Tuesday; but to our great surprise nothing was said on\\r\\nthe subject, and unless it is in your power to assist your brother with\\r\\nfive or six hundred pounds, he must entirely give up the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Nackington we met Lady Sondes\\' picture over the mantelpiece in the\\r\\ndining-room, and the pictures of her three children in an ante-room,\\r\\nbesides Mr. Scott, Miss Fletcher, Mr. Toke, Mr. J. Toke, and the\\r\\narchdeacon Lynch. Miss Fletcher and I were very thick, but I am the\\r\\nthinnest of the two. She wore her purple muslin, which is pretty\\r\\nenough, though it does not become her complexion. There are two traits\\r\\nin her character which are pleasing,--namely, she admires Camilla, and\\r\\ndrinks no cream in her tea. If you should ever see Lucy, you may tell\\r\\nher that I scolded Miss Fletcher for her negligence in writing, as she\\r\\ndesired me to do, but without being able to bring her to any proper\\r\\nsense of shame,--that Miss Fletcher says, in her defence, that as\\r\\neverybody whom Lucy knew when she was in Canterbury has now left it, she\\r\\nhas nothing at all to write to her about. By _everybody_, I suppose Miss\\r\\nFletcher means that a new set of officers have arrived there. But this\\r\\nis a note of my own.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milles, Mr. John Toke, and in short everybody of any sensibility\\r\\ninquired in tender strains after you, and I took an opportunity of\\r\\nassuring Mr. J. T. that neither he nor his father need longer keep\\r\\nthemselves single for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went in our two carriages to Nackington; but how we divided I shall\\r\\nleave you to surmise, merely observing that as Elizabeth and I were\\r\\nwithout either hat or bonnet, it would not have been very convenient for\\r\\nus to go in the chaise. We went by Bifrons, and I contemplated with a\\r\\nmelancholy pleasure the abode of him on whom I once fondly doated. We\\r\\ndine to-day at Goodnestone, to meet my aunt Fielding from Margate and a\\r\\nMr. Clayton, her professed admirer--at least, so I imagine. Lady Bridges\\r\\nhas received very good accounts of Marianne, who is already certainly\\r\\nthe better for her bathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo His Royal Highness Sir Thomas Williams has at length sailed; the\\r\\npapers say \"on a cruise.\" But I hope they are gone to Cork, or I shall\\r\\nhave written in vain. Give my love to Jane, as she arrived at Steventon\\r\\nyesterday, I dare say.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sent a message to Mr. Digweed from Edward in a letter to Mary Lloyd\\r\\nwhich she ought to receive to-day; but as I know that the Harwoods are\\r\\nnot very exact as to their letters, I may as well repeat it to you. Mr.\\r\\nDigweed is to be informed that illness has prevented Seward\\'s coming\\r\\nover to look at the repairs intended at the farm, but that he will come\\r\\nas soon as he can. Mr. Digweed may also be informed, if you think\\r\\nproper, that Mr. and Mrs. Milles are to dine here to-morrow, and that\\r\\nMrs. Joan Knatchbull is to be asked to meet them. Mr. Richard Harvey\\'s\\r\\nmatch is put off till he has got a better Christian name, of which he\\r\\nhas great hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Children\\'s two sons are both going to be married, John and George.\\r\\nThey are to have one wife between them, a Miss Holwell, who belongs to\\r\\nthe Black Hole at Calcutta. I depend on hearing from James very soon; he\\r\\npromised me an account of the ball, and by this time he must have\\r\\ncollected his ideas enough after the fatigue of dancing to give me one.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward and Fly went out yesterday very early in a couple of shooting\\r\\njackets, and came home like a couple of bad shots, for they killed\\r\\nnothing at all. They are out again to-day, and are not yet returned.\\r\\nDelightful sport! They are just come home, Edward with his two brace,\\r\\nFrank with his two and a half. What amiable young men!\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friday._--Your letter and one from Henry are just come, and the\\r\\ncontents of both accord with my scheme more than I had dared expect. In\\r\\none particular I could wish it otherwise, for Henry is very indifferent\\r\\nindeed. You must not expect us quite so early, however, as Wednesday,\\r\\nthe 20th,--on that day se\\'nnight, according to our present plan, we may\\r\\nbe with you. Frank had never any idea of going away before Monday, the\\r\\n26th. I shall write to Miss Mason immediately, and press her returning\\r\\nwith us, which Henry thinks very likely, and particularly eligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuy Mary Harrison\\'s gown by all means. You shall have mine for ever so\\r\\nmuch money, though, if I am tolerably rich when I get home, I shall like\\r\\nit very much myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the mode of our travelling to town, _I_ want to go in a\\r\\nstage-coach, but Frank will not let me. As you are likely to have the\\r\\nWilliams and Lloyds with you next week, you would hardly find room for\\r\\nus then. If any one wants anything in town, they must send their\\r\\ncommissions to Frank, as _I_ shall merely pass through it. The\\r\\ntallow-chandler is Penlington, at the Crown and Beehive, Charles Street,\\r\\nCovent Garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        ROWLING, Sunday (September 18).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--This morning has been spent in doubt and\\r\\ndeliberation, in forming plans and removing difficulties, for it ushered\\r\\nin the day with an event which I had not intended should take place so\\r\\nsoon by a week. Frank has received his appointment on board the \"Captain\\r\\nJohn Gore,\" commanded by the \"Triton,\" and will therefore be obliged to\\r\\nbe in town on Wednesday; and though I have every disposition in the\\r\\nworld to accompany him on that day, I cannot go on the uncertainty of\\r\\nthe Pearsons being at home, as I should not have a place to go to in\\r\\ncase they were from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote to Miss P. on Friday, and hoped to receive an answer from her\\r\\nthis morning, which would have rendered everything smooth and easy, and\\r\\nwould have enabled us to leave this place to-morrow, as Frank, on first\\r\\nreceiving his appointment, intended to do. He remains till Wednesday\\r\\nmerely to accommodate me. I have written to her again to-day, and\\r\\ndesired her to answer it by return of post. On Tuesday, therefore, I\\r\\nshall positively know whether they can receive me on Wednesday. If they\\r\\ncannot, Edward has been so good as to promise to take me to Greenwich on\\r\\nthe Monday following, which was the day before fixed on, if that suits\\r\\nthem better. If I have no answer at all on Tuesday, I must suppose Mary\\r\\nis not at home, and must wait till I do hear, as after having invited\\r\\nher to go to Steventon with me, it will not quite do to go home and say\\r\\nno more about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father will be so good as to fetch home his prodigal daughter from\\r\\ntown, I hope, unless he wishes me to walk the hospitals, enter at the\\r\\nTemple, or mount guard at St. James\\'. It will hardly be in Frank\\'s power\\r\\nto take me home,--nay, it certainly will not. I shall write again as\\r\\nsoon as I get to Greenwich.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat dreadful hot weather we have! It keeps one in a continual state of\\r\\ninelegance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Miss Pearson should return with me, pray be careful not to expect too\\r\\nmuch beauty. I will not pretend to say that on a first view she quite\\r\\nanswered the opinion I had formed of her. My mother, I am sure, will be\\r\\ndisappointed if she does not take great care. From what I remember of\\r\\nher picture, it is no great resemblance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very glad that the idea of returning with Frank occurred to me; for\\r\\nas to Henry\\'s coming into Kent again, the time of its taking place is so\\r\\nvery uncertain that I should be waiting for dead men\\'s shoes. I had once\\r\\ndetermined to go with Frank to-morrow and take my chance, etc., but they\\r\\ndissuaded me from so rash a step as I really think on consideration it\\r\\nwould have been; for if the Pearsons were not at home, I should\\r\\ninevitably fall a sacrifice to the arts of some fat woman who would make\\r\\nme drunk with small beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary is brought to bed of a boy,--both doing very well. I shall leave\\r\\nyou to guess what Mary I mean. Adieu, with best love to all your\\r\\nagreeable inmates. Don\\'t let the Lloyds go on any account before I\\r\\nreturn, unless Miss P. is of the party. How ill I have written! I begin\\r\\nto hate myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 Yours ever,\\r\\n                                                          J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"Triton\" is a new 32 frigate just launched at Deptford. Frank is\\r\\nmuch pleased with the prospect of having Captain Gore under his command.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    \"BULL AND GEORGE,\" DARTFORD,\\r\\n                                        Wednesday (October 24, 1798).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--You have already heard from Daniel, I conclude, in\\r\\nwhat excellent time we reached and quitted Sittingbourne, and how very\\r\\nwell my mother bore her journey thither. I am now able to send you a\\r\\ncontinuation of the same good account of her. She was very little\\r\\nfatigued on her arrival at this place, has been refreshed by a\\r\\ncomfortable dinner, and now seems quite stout. It wanted five minutes of\\r\\ntwelve when we left Sittingbourne, from whence we had a famous pair of\\r\\nhorses, which took us to Rochester in an hour and a quarter; the postboy\\r\\nseemed determined to show my mother that Kentish drivers were not always\\r\\ntedious, and really drove as fast as Cax.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur next stage was not quite so expeditiously performed; the road was\\r\\nheavy, and our horses very indifferent. However, we were in such good\\r\\ntime and my mother bore her journey so well, that expedition was of\\r\\nlittle importance to us; and as it was, we were very little more than\\r\\ntwo hours and a half coming hither, and it was scarcely past four when\\r\\nwe stopped at the inn. My mother took some of her bitters at Ospringe,\\r\\nand some more at Rochester, and she ate some bread several times.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have got apartments up two pair of stairs, as we could not be\\r\\notherwise accommodated with a sitting-room and bed-chambers on the same\\r\\nfloor which we wished to be. We have one double-bedded and one\\r\\nsingle-bedded room; in the former my mother and I are to sleep. I shall\\r\\nleave you to guess who is to occupy the other. We sate down to dinner a\\r\\nlittle after five, and had some beef-steaks and a boiled fowl, but no\\r\\noyster sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have begun my letter soon after our arrival, but for a little\\r\\nadventure which prevented me. After we had been here a quarter of an\\r\\nhour it was discovered that my writing and dressing boxes had been by\\r\\naccident put into a chaise which was just packing off as we came in, and\\r\\nwere driven away toward Gravesend in their way to the West Indies. No\\r\\npart of my property could have been such a prize before, for in my\\r\\nwriting-box was all my worldly wealth, 7_l._, and my dear Harry\\'s\\r\\ndeputation. Mr. Nottley immediately despatched a man and horse after the\\r\\nchaise, and in half an hour\\'s time I had the pleasure of being as rich\\r\\nas ever; they were got about two or three miles off.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy day\\'s journey has been pleasanter in every respect than I expected. I\\r\\nhave been very little crowded and by no means unhappy. Your\\r\\nwatchfulness with regard to the weather on our accounts was very kind\\r\\nand very effectual. We had one heavy shower on leaving Sittingbourne,\\r\\nbut afterwards the clouds cleared away, and we had a very bright\\r\\n_chrystal_ afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father is now reading the \"Midnight Bell,\" which he has got from the\\r\\nlibrary, and mother sitting by the fire. Our route to-morrow is not\\r\\ndetermined. We have none of us much inclination for London, and if Mr.\\r\\nNottley will give us leave, I think we shall go to Staines through\\r\\nCroydon and Kingston, which will be much pleasanter than any other way;\\r\\nbut he is decidedly for Clapham and Battersea. God bless you all!\\r\\n\\r\\n                                         Yours affectionately, J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\nI flatter myself that _itty Dordy_ will not forget me at least under a\\r\\nweek. Kiss him for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    STEVENTON, Saturday (October 27).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter was a most agreeable surprise to me\\r\\nto-day, and I have taken a long sheet of paper to show my gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived here yesterday between four and five, but I cannot send you\\r\\nquite so triumphant an account of our last day\\'s journey as of the\\r\\nfirst and second. Soon after I had finished my letter from Staines, my\\r\\nmother began to suffer from the exercise or fatigue of travelling, and\\r\\nshe was a good deal indisposed. She had not a very good night at\\r\\nStaines, but bore her journey better than I had expected, and at\\r\\nBasingstoke, where we stopped more than half an hour, received much\\r\\ncomfort from a mess of broth and the sight of Mr. Lyford, who\\r\\nrecommended her to take twelve drops of laudanum when she went to bed as\\r\\na composer, which she accordingly did.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames called on us just as we were going to tea, and my mother was well\\r\\nenough to talk very cheerfully to him before she went to bed. James\\r\\nseems to have taken to his old trick of coming to Steventon in spite of\\r\\nMary\\'s reproaches, for he was here before breakfast and is now paying us\\r\\na second visit. They were to have dined here to-day, but the weather is\\r\\ntoo bad. I have had the pleasure of hearing that Martha is with them.\\r\\nJames fetched her from Ibthorp on Thursday, and she will stay with them\\r\\ntill she removes to Kintbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met with no adventures at all in our journey yesterday, except that\\r\\nour trunk had once nearly slipped off, and we were obliged to stop at\\r\\nHartley to have our wheels greased.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst my mother and Mr. Lyford were together I went to Mrs. Ryder\\'s and\\r\\nbought what I intended to buy, but not in much perfection. There were\\r\\nno narrow braces for children, and scarcely any notting silk; but Miss\\r\\nWood, as usual, is going to town very soon, and will lay in a fresh\\r\\nstock. I gave 2_s._ 3_d._ a yard for my flannel, and I fancy it is not\\r\\nvery good, but it is so disgraceful and contemptible an article in\\r\\nitself that its being comparatively good or bad is of little importance.\\r\\nI bought some Japan ink likewise, and next week shall begin my\\r\\noperations on my hat, on which you know my principal hopes of happiness\\r\\ndepend.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very grand indeed; I had the dignity of dropping out my mother\\'s\\r\\nlaudanum last night. I carry about the keys of the wine and closet, and\\r\\ntwice since I began this letter have had orders to give in the kitchen.\\r\\nOur dinner was very good yesterday, and the chicken boiled perfectly\\r\\ntender; therefore I shall not be obliged to dismiss Nanny on that\\r\\naccount.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost everything was unpacked and put away last night. Nanny chose to\\r\\ndo it, and I was not sorry to be busy. I have unpacked the gloves, and\\r\\nplaced yours in your drawer. Their color is light and pretty, and I\\r\\nbelieve exactly what we fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour letter was chaperoned here by one from Mrs. Cooke, in which she\\r\\nsays that \"Battleridge\" is not to come out before January, and she is so\\r\\nlittle satisfied with Cawthorn\\'s dilatoriness that she never means to\\r\\nemploy him again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hall, of Sherborne, was brought to bed yesterday of a dead child,\\r\\nsome weeks before she expected, owing to a fright. I suppose she\\r\\nhappened unawares to look at her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been a great deal of rain here for this last fortnight, much\\r\\nmore than in Kent, and indeed we found the roads all the way from\\r\\nStaines most disgracefully dirty. Steventon lane has its full share of\\r\\nit, and I don\\'t know when I shall be able to get to Deane.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear that Martha is in better looks and spirits than she has enjoyed\\r\\nfor a long time, and I flatter myself she will now be able to jest\\r\\nopenly about Mr. W.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spectacles which Molly found are my mother\\'s, the scissors my\\r\\nfather\\'s. We are very glad to hear such a good account of your patients,\\r\\nlittle and great. My dear itty Dordy\\'s remembrance of me is very\\r\\npleasing to me,--foolishly pleasing, because I know it will be over so\\r\\nsoon. My attachment to him will be more durable. I shall think with\\r\\ntenderness and delight on his beautiful and smiling countenance and\\r\\ninteresting manner until a few years have turned him into an\\r\\nungovernable, ungracious fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe books from Winton are all unpacked and put away; the binding has\\r\\ncompressed them most conveniently, and there is now very good room in\\r\\nthe bookcase for all that we wish to have there. I believe the servants\\r\\nwere very glad to see us Nanny was, I am sure. She confesses that it\\r\\nwas very dull, and yet she had her child with her till last Sunday. I\\r\\nunderstand that there are some grapes left, but I believe not many; they\\r\\nmust be gathered as soon as possible, or this rain will entirely rot\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am quite angry with myself for not writing closer; why is my alphabet\\r\\nso much more sprawly than yours? Dame Tilbury\\'s daughter has lain in.\\r\\nShall I give her any of your baby clothes? The laceman was here only a\\r\\nfew days ago. How unfortunate for both of us that he came so soon! Dame\\r\\nBushell washes for us only one week more, as Sukey has got a place. John\\r\\nSteevens\\' wife undertakes our purification. She does not look as if\\r\\nanything she touched would ever be clean, but who knows? We do not seem\\r\\nlikely to have any other maidservant at present, but Dame Staples will\\r\\nsupply the place of one. Mary has hired a young girl from Ashe who has\\r\\nnever been out to service to be her scrub, but James fears her not being\\r\\nstrong enough for the place.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarle Harwood has been to Deane lately, as I think Mary wrote us word,\\r\\nand his family then told him that they would receive his wife, if she\\r\\ncontinued to behave well for another year. He was very grateful, as well\\r\\nhe might; their behavior throughout the whole affair has been\\r\\nparticularly kind. Earle and his wife live in the most private manner\\r\\nimaginable at Portsmouth, without keeping a servant of any kind. What a\\r\\nprodigious innate love of virtue she must have, to marry under such\\r\\ncircumstances!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now Saturday evening, but I wrote the chief of this in the\\r\\nmorning. My mother has not been down at all to-day; the laudanum made\\r\\nher sleep a good deal, and upon the whole I think she is better. My\\r\\nfather and I dined by ourselves. How strange! He and John Bond are now\\r\\nvery happy together, for I have just heard the heavy step of the latter\\r\\nalong the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Digweed called to-day, and I gave him his brother\\'s deputation.\\r\\nCharles Harwood, too, has just called to ask how we are, in his way from\\r\\nDummer, whither he has been conveying Miss Garrett, who is going to\\r\\nreturn to her former residence in Kent. I will leave off, or I shall not\\r\\nhave room to add a word to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sunday._--My mother has had a very good night, and feels much better\\r\\nto-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received my aunt\\'s letter, and thank you for your scrap. I will\\r\\nwrite to Charles soon. Pray give Fanny and Edward a kiss from me, and\\r\\nask George if he has got a new song for me. \\'Tis really very kind of my\\r\\naunt to ask us to Bath again; a kindness that deserves a better return\\r\\nthan to profit by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 Yours ever,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 STEVENTON, December 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I am so good as to write to you again thus speedily,\\r\\nto let you know that I have just heard from Frank. He was at Cadiz,\\r\\nalive and well, on October 19, and had then very lately received a\\r\\nletter from you, written as long ago as when the \"London\" was at St.\\r\\nHelen\\'s. But his _raly_ latest intelligence of us was in one from me of\\r\\nSeptember 1, which I sent soon after we got to Godmersham. He had\\r\\nwritten a packet full for his dearest friends in England, early in\\r\\nOctober, to go by the \"Excellent;\" but the \"Excellent\" was not sailed,\\r\\nnor likely to sail, when he despatched this to me. It comprehended\\r\\nletters for both of us, for Lord Spencer, Mr. Daysh, and the East India\\r\\nDirectors. Lord St. Vincent had left the fleet when he wrote, and was\\r\\ngone to Gibraltar, it was said to superintend the fitting out of a\\r\\nprivate expedition from thence against some of the enemies\\' ports;\\r\\nMinorca or Malta were conjectured to be the objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank writes in good spirits, but says that our correspondence cannot be\\r\\nso easily carried on in future as it has been, as the communication\\r\\nbetween Cadiz and Lisbon is less frequent than formerly. You and my\\r\\nmother, therefore, must not alarm yourselves at the long intervals that\\r\\nmay divide his letters. I address this advice to you two as being the\\r\\nmost tender-hearted of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother made her _entr\\xc3\\xa9e_ into the dressing-room through crowds of\\r\\nadmiring spectators yesterday afternoon, and we all drank tea together\\r\\nfor the first time these five weeks. She has had a tolerable night, and\\r\\nbids fair for a continuance in the same brilliant course of action\\r\\nto-day. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Lyford was here yesterday; he came while we were at dinner, and\\r\\npartook of our elegant entertainment. I was not ashamed at asking him to\\r\\nsit down to table, for we had some pease-soup, a sparerib, and a\\r\\npudding. He wants my mother to look yellow and to throw out a rash, but\\r\\nshe will do neither.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at Deane yesterday morning. Mary was very well, but does not gain\\r\\nbodily strength very fast. When I saw her so stout on the third and\\r\\nsixth days, I expected to have seen her as well as ever by the end of a\\r\\nfortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames went to Ibthorp yesterday to see his mother and child. Letty is\\r\\nwith Mary[3] at present, of course exceedingly happy, and in raptures\\r\\nwith the child. Mary does not manage matters in such a way as to make me\\r\\nwant to lay in myself. She is not tidy enough in her appearance; she has\\r\\nno dressing-gown to sit up in; her curtains are all too thin, and\\r\\nthings are not in that comfort and style about her which are necessary\\r\\nto make such a situation an enviable one. Elizabeth was really a pretty\\r\\nobject with her nice clean cap put on so tidily and her dress so\\r\\nuniformly white and orderly. We live entirely in the dressing-room now,\\r\\nwhich I like very much; I always feel so much more elegant in it than in\\r\\nthe parlor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo news from Kintbury yet. Eliza sports with our impatience. She was\\r\\nvery well last Thursday. Who is Miss Maria Montresor going to marry, and\\r\\nwhat is to become of Miss Mulcaster?\\r\\n\\r\\nI find great comfort in my stuff gown, but I hope you do not wear yours\\r\\ntoo often. I have made myself two or three caps to wear of evenings\\r\\nsince I came home, and they save me a world of torment as to\\r\\nhairdressing, which at present gives me no trouble beyond washing and\\r\\nbrushing, for my long hair is always plaited up out of sight, and my\\r\\nshort hair curls well enough to want no papering. I have had it cut\\r\\nlately by Mr. Butler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no reason to suppose that Miss Morgan is dead after all. Mr.\\r\\nLyford gratified us very much yesterday by his praises of my father\\'s\\r\\nmutton, which they all think the finest that was ever ate. John Bond\\r\\nbegins to find himself grow old, which John Bonds ought not to do, and\\r\\nunequal to much hard work; a man is therefore hired to supply his place\\r\\nas to labor, and John himself is to have the care of the sheep. There\\r\\nare not more people engaged than before, I believe; only men instead of\\r\\nboys. I fancy so at least, but you know my stupidity as to such matters.\\r\\nLizzie Bond is just apprenticed to Miss Small, so we may hope to see her\\r\\nable to spoil gowns in a few years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father has applied to Mr. May for an ale-house for Robert, at his\\r\\nrequest, and to Mr. Deane, of Winchester, likewise. This was my mother\\'s\\r\\nidea, who thought he would be proud to oblige a relation of Edward in\\r\\nreturn for Edward\\'s accepting his money. He sent a very civil answer\\r\\nindeed, but has no house vacant at present. May expects to have an empty\\r\\none soon at Farnham, so perhaps Nanny may have the honor of drawing ale\\r\\nfor the Bishop. I shall write to Frank to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Powlett gave a dance on Thursday, to the great disturbance of\\r\\nall his neighbors, of course, who, you know, take a most lively interest\\r\\nin the state of his finances, and live in hopes of his being soon\\r\\nruined.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are very much disposed to like our new maid; she knows nothing of a\\r\\ndairy, to be sure, which, in our family, is rather against her, but she\\r\\nis to be taught it all. In short, we have felt the inconvenience of\\r\\nbeing without a maid so long, that we are determined to like her, and\\r\\nshe will find it a hard matter to displease us. As yet, she seems to\\r\\ncook very well, is uncommonly stout, and says she can work well at her\\r\\nneedle.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sunday._--My father is glad to hear so good an account of Edward\\'s\\r\\npigs, and desires he may be told, as encouragement to his taste for\\r\\nthem, that Lord Bolton is particularly curious in _his_ pigs, has had\\r\\npigstyes of a most elegant construction built for them, and visits them\\r\\nevery morning as soon as he rises.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                             Affectionately yours,\\r\\n                                                                 J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] Mrs. James Austen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    STEVENTON, Tuesday (December 18).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter came quite as soon as I expected, and so\\r\\nyour letters will always do, because I have made it a rule not to expect\\r\\nthem till they come, in which I think I consult the ease of us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a great satisfaction to us to hear that your business is in a way\\r\\nto be settled, and so settled as to give you as little inconvenience as\\r\\npossible. You are very welcome to my father\\'s name and to his services\\r\\nif they are ever required in it. I shall keep my ten pounds too, to wrap\\r\\nmyself up in next winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the liberty a few days ago of asking your black velvet bonnet to\\r\\nlend me its cawl, which it very readily did, and by which I have been\\r\\nenabled to give a considerable improvement of dignity to cap, which was\\r\\nbefore too _nidgetty_ to please me. I shall wear it on Thursday, but I\\r\\nhope you will not be offended with me for following your advice as to\\r\\nits ornaments only in part. I still venture to retain the narrow silver\\r\\nround it, put twice round without any bow, and instead of the black\\r\\nmilitary feather shall put in the coquelicot one as being smarter, and\\r\\nbesides coquelicot is to be all the fashion this winter. After the ball\\r\\nI shall probably make it entirely black.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sorry that our dear Charles begins to feel the dignity of\\r\\nill-usage. My father will write to Admiral Gambier. He must have already\\r\\nreceived so much satisfaction from his acquaintance and patronage of\\r\\nFrank, that he will be delighted, I dare say, to have another of the\\r\\nfamily introduced to him. I think it would be very right in Charles to\\r\\naddress Sir Thomas on the occasion, though I cannot approve of your\\r\\nscheme of writing to him (which you communicated to me a few nights ago)\\r\\nto request him to come home and convey you to Steventon. To do you\\r\\njustice, however, you had some doubts of the propriety of such a measure\\r\\nyourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very much obliged to my dear little George for his message,--for\\r\\nhis love at least; his duty, I suppose, was only in consequence of some\\r\\nhint of my favorable intentions towards him from his father or mother. I\\r\\nam sincerely rejoiced, however, that I ever was born, since it has been\\r\\nthe means of procuring him a dish of tea. Give my best love to him. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday._--I have changed my mind, and changed the trimmings of my\\r\\ncap this morning; they are now such as you suggested. I felt as if I\\r\\nshould not prosper if I strayed from your directions, and I think it\\r\\nmakes me look more like Lady Conyngham now than it did before, which is\\r\\nall that one lives for now. I believe I _shall_ make my new gown like my\\r\\nrobe, but the back of the latter is all in a piece with the tail, and\\r\\nwill seven yards enable me to copy it in that respect? . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just heard from Martha and Frank: his letter was written on\\r\\nNovember 12. All well and nothing particular.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                STEVENTON, Monday night (December 24).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I have got some pleasant news for you which I am\\r\\neager to communicate, and therefore begin my letter sooner, though I\\r\\nshall not send it sooner than usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Gambier, in reply to my father\\'s application, writes as follows:\\r\\n\"As it is usual to keep young officers in small vessels, it being most\\r\\nproper on account of their inexperience, and it being also a situation\\r\\nwhere they are more in the way of learning their duty, your son has been\\r\\ncontinued in the \\'Scorpion;\\' but I have mentioned to the Board of\\r\\nAdmiralty his wish to be in a frigate, and when a proper opportunity\\r\\noffers and it is judged that he has taken his turn in a small ship, I\\r\\nhope he will be removed. With regard to your son now in the \\'London\\' I\\r\\nam glad I can give you the assurance that his promotion is likely to\\r\\ntake place very soon, as Lord Spencer has been so good as to say he\\r\\nwould include him in an arrangement that he proposes making in a short\\r\\ntime relative to some promotions in that quarter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere! I may now finish my letter and go and hang myself, for I am sure\\r\\nI can neither write nor do anything which will not appear insipid to you\\r\\nafter this. _Now_ I really think he will soon be made, and only wish we\\r\\ncould communicate our foreknowledge of the event to him whom it\\r\\nprincipally concerns. My father has written to Daysh to desire that he\\r\\nwill inform us, if he can, when the commission is sent. Your chief wish\\r\\nis now ready to be accomplished; and could Lord Spencer give happiness\\r\\nto Martha at the same time, what a joyful heart he would make of yours!\\r\\n\\r\\nI have sent the same extract of the sweets of Gambier to Charles, who,\\r\\npoor fellow, though he sinks into nothing but an humble attendant on the\\r\\nhero of the piece, will, I hope, be contented with the prospect held out\\r\\nto him. By what the Admiral says, it appears as if he had been\\r\\ndesignedly kept in the \"Scorpion.\" But I will not torment myself with\\r\\nconjectures and suppositions; facts shall satisfy me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank had not heard from any of us for ten weeks when he wrote to me on\\r\\nNovember 12 in consequence of Lord St. Vincent being removed to\\r\\nGibraltar. When his commission is sent, however, it will not be so long\\r\\non its road as our letters, because all the Government despatches are\\r\\nforwarded by land to his lordship from Lisbon with great regularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned from Manydown this morning, and found my mother certainly in\\r\\nno respect worse than when I left her. She does not like the cold\\r\\nweather, but that we cannot help. I spent my time very quietly and very\\r\\npleasantly with Catherine. Miss Blackford is agreeable enough. I do not\\r\\nwant people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking\\r\\nthem a great deal. I found only Catherine and her when I got to Manydown\\r\\non Thursday. We dined together, and went together to Worting to seek the\\r\\nprotection of Mrs. Clarke, with whom were Lady Mildmay, her eldest son,\\r\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Hoare.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ball was very thin, but by no means unpleasant. There were\\r\\nthirty-one people, and only eleven ladies out of the number, and but\\r\\nfive single women in the room. Of the gentlemen present you may have\\r\\nsome idea from the list of my partners,--Mr. Wood, G. Lefroy, Rice, a\\r\\nMr. Butcher (belonging to the Temples, a sailor and not of the 11th\\r\\nLight Dragoons), Mr. Temple (not the horrid one of all), Mr. Wm. Orde\\r\\n(cousin to the Kingsclere man), Mr. John Harwood, and Mr. Calland, who\\r\\nappeared as usual with his hat in his hand, and stood every now and then\\r\\nbehind Catherine and me to be talked to and abused for not dancing. We\\r\\nteased him, however, into it at last. I was very glad to see him again\\r\\nafter so long a separation, and he was altogether rather the genius and\\r\\nflirt of the evening. He inquired after you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were twenty dances, and I danced them all, and without any\\r\\nfatigue. I was glad to find myself capable of dancing so much, and with\\r\\nso much satisfaction as I did; from my slender enjoyment of the Ashford\\r\\nballs (as assemblies for dancing) I had not thought myself equal to it,\\r\\nbut in cold weather and with few couples I fancy I could just as well\\r\\ndance for a week together as for half an hour. My black cap was openly\\r\\nadmired by Mrs. Lefroy, and secretly I imagine by everybody else in the\\r\\nroom. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Edward! It is very hard that he, who has everything else in the\\r\\nworld that he can wish for, should not have good health too. But I hope\\r\\nwith the assistance of stomach complaints, faintnesses, and sicknesses,\\r\\nhe will soon be restored to that blessing likewise. If his nervous\\r\\ncomplaint proceeded from a suppression of something that ought to be\\r\\nthrown out, which does not seem unlikely, the first of these disorders\\r\\nmay really be a remedy, and I sincerely wish it may, for I know no one\\r\\nmore deserving of happiness without alloy than Edward is. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lords of the Admiralty will have enough of our applications at\\r\\npresent, for I hear from Charles that he has written to Lord Spencer\\r\\nhimself to be removed. I am afraid his Serene Highness will be in a\\r\\npassion, and order some of our heads to be cut off. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nYou deserve a longer letter than this; but it is my unhappy fate seldom\\r\\nto treat people so well as they deserve. . . . God bless you!\\r\\n\\r\\n                                         Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                          JANE AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday._--The snow came to nothing yesterday, so I did go to Deane,\\r\\nand returned home at nine o\\'clock at night in the little carriage, and\\r\\nwithout being very cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      STEVENTON, Friday (December 28).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Frank is made. He was yesterday raised to the rank\\r\\nof Commander, and appointed to the \"Petterel\" sloop, now at Gibraltar. A\\r\\nletter from Daysh has just announced this, and as it is confirmed by a\\r\\nvery friendly one from Mr. Mathew to the same effect, transcribing one\\r\\nfrom Admiral Gambier to the General, we have no reason to suspect the\\r\\ntruth of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as you have cried a little for joy, you may go on, and learn\\r\\nfurther that the India House have taken _Captain Austen\\'s_ petition into\\r\\nconsideration,--this comes from Daysh,--and likewise that Lieutenant\\r\\nCharles John Austen is removed to the \"Tamar\" frigate,--this comes from\\r\\nthe Admiral. We cannot find out where the \"Tamar\" is, but I hope we\\r\\nshall now see Charles here at all events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter is to be dedicated entirely to good news. If you will send\\r\\nmy father an account of your washing and letter expenses, etc., he will\\r\\nsend you a draft for the amount of it, as well as for your next quarter,\\r\\nand for Edward\\'s rent. If you don\\'t buy a muslin gown now on the\\r\\nstrength of this money and Frank\\'s promotion, I shall never forgive\\r\\nyou.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Lefroy has just sent me word that Lady Dorchester meant to invite\\r\\nme to her ball on January 8, which, though an humble blessing compared\\r\\nwith what the last page records, I do not consider as any calamity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot write any more now, but I have written enough to make you very\\r\\nhappy, and therefore may safely conclude.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                     Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Godmersham Park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              STEVENTON, Tuesday (January 8, 1799).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--You must read your letters over _five_ times in\\r\\nfuture before you send them, and then, perhaps, you may find them as\\r\\nentertaining as I do. I laughed at several parts of the one which I am\\r\\nnow answering.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles is not come yet, but he must come this morning, or he shall\\r\\nnever know what I will do to him. The ball at Kempshott is this evening,\\r\\nand I have got him an invitation, though I have not been so considerate\\r\\nas to get him a partner. But the cases are different between him and\\r\\nEliza Bailey, for he is not in a dying way, and may therefore be equal\\r\\nto getting a partner for himself. I believe I told you that Monday was\\r\\nto be the ball night, for which, and for all other errors into which I\\r\\nmay ever have led you, I humbly ask your pardon.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth is very cruel about my writing music, and, as a punishment for\\r\\nher, I should insist upon always writing out all hers for her in future,\\r\\nif I were not punishing myself at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am tolerably glad to hear that Edward\\'s income is so good a one,--as\\r\\nglad as I can be at anybody\\'s being rich except you and me,--and I am\\r\\nthoroughly rejoiced to hear of his present to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not to wear my white satin cap to-night, after all; I am to wear a\\r\\nmamalone cap instead, which Charles Fowle sent to Mary, and which she\\r\\nlends me. It is all the fashion now; worn at the opera, and by Lady\\r\\nMildmays at Hackwood balls. I hate describing such things, and I dare\\r\\nsay you will be able to guess what it is like. I have got over the\\r\\ndreadful epocha of mantua-making much better than I expected. My gown is\\r\\nmade very much like my blue one, which you always told me sat very well,\\r\\nwith only these variations: the sleeves are short, the wrap fuller, the\\r\\napron comes over it, and a band of the same completes the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nI assure you that I dread the idea of going to Brighton as much as you\\r\\ndo, but I am not without hopes that something may happen to prevent it.\\r\\n\\r\\nF---- has lost his election at B----, and perhaps they may not be able\\r\\nto see company for some time. They talk of going to Bath, too, in the\\r\\nspring, and perhaps they may be overturned in their way down, and all\\r\\nlaid up for the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday._--I have had a cold and weakness in one of my eyes for some\\r\\ndays, which makes writing neither very pleasant nor very profitable, and\\r\\nwhich will probably prevent my finishing this letter myself. My mother\\r\\nhas undertaken to do it for me, and I shall leave the Kempshott ball for\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou express so little anxiety about my being murdered under Ash Park\\r\\nCopse by Mrs. Hulbert\\'s servant, that I have a great mind not to tell\\r\\nyou whether I was or not, and shall only say that I did not return home\\r\\nthat night or the next, as Martha kindly made room for me in her bed,\\r\\nwhich was the shut-up one in the new nursery. Nurse and the child slept\\r\\nupon the floor, and there we all were in some confusion and great\\r\\ncomfort. The bed did exceedingly well for us, both to lie awake in and\\r\\ntalk till two o\\'clock, and to sleep in the rest of the night. I love\\r\\nMartha better than ever, and I mean to go and see her, if I can, when\\r\\nshe gets home. We all dined at the Harwoods\\' on Thursday, and the party\\r\\nbroke up the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis complaint in my eye has been a sad bore to me, for I have not been\\r\\nable to read or work in any comfort since Friday; but one advantage\\r\\nwill be derived from it, for I shall be such a proficient in music by\\r\\nthe time I have got rid of my cold, that I shall be perfectly qualified\\r\\nin that science at least to take Mr. Roope\\'s office at Eastwell next\\r\\nsummer; and I am sure of Elizabeth\\'s recommendation, be it only on\\r\\nHarriet\\'s account. Of my talent in drawing I have given specimens in my\\r\\nletters to you, and I have nothing to do but to invent a few hard names\\r\\nfor the stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary grows rather more reasonable about her child\\'s beauty, and says\\r\\nthat she does not think him really handsome; but I suspect her\\r\\nmoderation to be something like that of W---- W----\\'s mamma. Perhaps\\r\\nMary has told you that they are going to enter more into dinner-parties;\\r\\nthe Biggs and Mr. Holder dine there to-morrow, and I am to meet them. I\\r\\nshall sleep there. Catherine has the honor of giving her name to a set,\\r\\nwhich will be composed of two Withers, two Heathcotes, a Blackford, and\\r\\nno Bigg except herself. She congratulated me last night on Frank\\'s\\r\\npromotion, as if she really felt the joy she talked of.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sweet little George! I am delighted to hear that he has such an\\r\\ninventive genius as to face-making. I admired his yellow wafer very\\r\\nmuch, and hope he will choose the wafer for your next letter. I wore my\\r\\ngreen shoes last night, and took my white fan with me; I am very glad he\\r\\nnever threw it into the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Knight giving up the Godmersham estate to Edward was no such\\r\\nprodigious act of generosity after all, it seems, for she has reserved\\r\\nherself an income out of it still; this ought to be known, that her\\r\\nconduct may not be overrated. I rather think Edward shows the most\\r\\nmagnanimity of the two, in accepting her resignation with such\\r\\nincumbrances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I write, the better my eye gets; so I shall at least keep on\\r\\ntill it is quite well, before I give up my pen to my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bramston\\'s little movable apartment was tolerably filled last night\\r\\nby herself, Mrs. H. Blackstone, her two daughters, and me. I do not like\\r\\nthe Miss Blackstones; indeed, I was always determined not to like them,\\r\\nso there is the less merit in it. Mrs. Bramston was very civil, kind,\\r\\nand noisy. I spent a very pleasant evening, chiefly among the Manydown\\r\\nparty. There was the same kind of supper as last year, and the same want\\r\\nof chairs. There were more dancers than the room could conveniently\\r\\nhold, which is enough to constitute a good ball at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not think I was very much in request. People were rather apt not to\\r\\nask me till they could not help it; one\\'s consequence, you know, varies\\r\\nso much at times without any particular reason. There was one gentleman,\\r\\nan officer of the Cheshire, a very good-looking young man, who, I was\\r\\ntold, wanted very much to be introduced to me; but as he did not want\\r\\nit quite enough to take much trouble in effecting it, we never could\\r\\nbring it about.\\r\\n\\r\\nI danced with Mr. John Wood again, twice with a Mr. South, a lad from\\r\\nWinchester, who, I suppose, is as far from being related to the bishop\\r\\nof that diocese as it is possible to be, with G. Lefroy, and J. Harwood,\\r\\nwho, I think, takes to me rather more than he used to do. One of my\\r\\ngayest actions was sitting down two dances in preference to having Lord\\r\\nBolton\\'s eldest son for my partner, who danced too ill to be endured.\\r\\nThe Miss Charterises were there, and played the parts of the Miss Edens\\r\\nwith great spirit. Charles never came. Naughty Charles! I suppose he\\r\\ncould not get superseded in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Debary has replaced your two sheets of drawing-paper with two of\\r\\nsuperior size and quality; so I do not grudge her having taken them at\\r\\nall now. Mr. Ludlow and Miss Pugh of Andover are lately married, and so\\r\\nis Mrs. Skeete of Basingstoke, and Mr. French, chemist, of Reading.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not wonder at your wanting to read \"First Impressions\" again, so\\r\\nseldom as you have gone through it, and that so long ago. I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat behind you. I have\\r\\nlong secretly wished it might be done, but had not courage to make the\\r\\nrequest.\\r\\n\\r\\nPray mention the name of Maria Montresor\\'s lover when you write next. My\\r\\nmother wants to know it, and I have not courage to look back into your\\r\\nletters to find it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall not be able to send this till to-morrow, and you will be\\r\\ndisappointed on Friday; I am very sorry for it, but I cannot help it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe partnership between Jeffereys, Toomer, and Legge is dissolved; the\\r\\ntwo latter are melted away into nothing, and it is to be hoped that\\r\\nJeffereys will soon break, for the sake of a few heroines whose money he\\r\\nmay have. I wish you joy of your birthday twenty times over.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall be able to send this to the post to-day, which exalts me to the\\r\\nutmost pinnacle of human felicity, and makes me bask in the sunshine of\\r\\nprosperity or gives me any other sensation of pleasure in studied\\r\\nlanguage which you may prefer. Do not be angry with me for not filling\\r\\nmy sheet, and believe me yours affectionately,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    STEVENTON, Monday (January 21).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I will endeavor to make this letter more worthy your\\r\\nacceptance than my last, which was so shabby a one that I think Mr.\\r\\nMarshall could never charge you with the postage. My eyes have been\\r\\nvery indifferent since it was written, but are now getting better once\\r\\nmore; keeping them so many hours open on Thursday night, as well as the\\r\\ndust of the ballroom, injured them a good deal. I use them as little as\\r\\nI can, but you know, and Elizabeth knows, and everybody who ever had\\r\\nweak eyes knows, how delightful it is to hurt them by employment,\\r\\nagainst the advice and entreaty of all one\\'s friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles leaves us to-night. The \"Tamar\" is in the Downs, and Mr. Daysh\\r\\nadvises him to join her there directly, as there is no chance of her\\r\\ngoing to the westward. Charles does not approve of this at all, and will\\r\\nnot be much grieved if he should be too late for her before she sails,\\r\\nas he may then hope to get into a better station. He attempted to go to\\r\\ntown last night, and got as far on his road thither as Dean Gate; but\\r\\nboth the coaches were full, and we had the pleasure of seeing him back\\r\\nagain. He will call on Daysh to-morrow to know whether the \"Tamar\" has\\r\\nsailed or not, and if she is still at the Downs he will proceed in one\\r\\nof the night coaches to Deal. I want to go with him, that I may explain\\r\\nthe country to him properly between Canterbury and Rowling, but the\\r\\nunpleasantness of returning by myself deters me. I should like to go as\\r\\nfar as Ospringe with him very much indeed, that I might surprise you at\\r\\nGodmersham.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha writes me word that Charles was very much admired at Kintbury,\\r\\nand Mrs. Lefroy never saw any one so much improved in her life, and\\r\\nthinks him handsomer than Henry. He appears to far more advantage here\\r\\nthan he did at Godmersham, not surrounded by strangers and neither\\r\\noppressed by a pain in his face or powder in his hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames christened Elizabeth Caroline on Saturday morning, and then came\\r\\nhome. Mary, Anna, and Edward have left us of course; before the second\\r\\nwent I took down her answer to her cousin Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday came a letter to my mother from Edward Cooper to announce, not\\r\\nthe birth of a child, but of a living; for Mrs. Leigh has begged his\\r\\nacceptance of the Rectory of Hamstall-Ridware in Staffordshire, vacant\\r\\nby Mr. Johnson\\'s death. We collect from his letter that he means to\\r\\nreside there, in which he shows his wisdom. Staffordshire is a good way\\r\\noff; so we shall see nothing more of them till, some fifteen years\\r\\nhence, the Miss Coopers are presented to us, fine, jolly, handsome,\\r\\nignorant girls. The living is valued at 140_l._ a year, but perhaps it\\r\\nmay be improvable. How will they be able to convey the furniture of the\\r\\ndressing-room so far in safety?\\r\\n\\r\\nOur first cousins seem all dropping off very fast. One is incorporated\\r\\ninto the family, another dies, and a third goes into Staffordshire. We\\r\\ncan learn nothing of the disposal of the other living. I have not the\\r\\nsmallest notion of Fulwar\\'s having it. Lord Craven has probably other\\r\\nconnections and more intimate ones, in that line, than he now has with\\r\\nthe Kintbury family.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ball on Thursday was a very poor one, only eight couple and but\\r\\ntwenty-three people in the room; but it was not the ball\\'s fault, for we\\r\\nwere deprived of two or three families by the sudden illness of Mr.\\r\\nWither, who was seized that morning at Winchester with a return of his\\r\\nformer alarming complaint. An express was sent off from thence to the\\r\\nfamily; Catherine and Miss Blackford were dining with Mrs. Russell. Poor\\r\\nCatherine\\'s distress must have been very great. She was prevailed on to\\r\\nwait till the Heathcotes could come from Wintney, and then with those\\r\\ntwo and Harris proceeded directly to Winchester. In such a disorder his\\r\\ndanger, I suppose, must always be great; but from this attack he is now\\r\\nrapidly recovering, and will be well enough to return to Manydown, I\\r\\nfancy, in a few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fine thing for conversation at the ball. But it deprived us not\\r\\nonly of the Biggs, but of Mrs. Russell too, and of the Boltons and John\\r\\nHarwood, who were dining there likewise, and of Mr. Lane, who kept away\\r\\nas related to the family. Poor man!--I mean Mr. Wither--his life is so\\r\\nuseful, his character so respectable and worthy, that I really believe\\r\\nthere was a good deal of sincerity in the general concern expressed on\\r\\nhis account.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ball was chiefly made up of Jervoises and Terrys, the former of whom\\r\\nwere apt to be vulgar, the latter to be noisy. I had an odd set of\\r\\npartners: Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Street, Colonel Jervoise, James Digweed, J.\\r\\nLyford, and Mr. Briggs, a friend of the latter. I had a very pleasant\\r\\nevening, however, though you will probably find out that there was no\\r\\nparticular reason for it; but I do not think it worth while to wait for\\r\\nenjoyment until there is some real opportunity for it. Mary behaved very\\r\\nwell, and was not at all fidgetty. For the history of her adventures at\\r\\nthe ball I refer you to Anna\\'s letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you come home you will have some shirts to make up for Charles.\\r\\nMrs. Davies frightened him into buying a piece of Irish when we were in\\r\\nBasingstoke. Mr. Daysh supposes that Captain Austen\\'s commission has\\r\\nreached him by this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tuesday._--Your letter has pleased and amused me very much. Your essay\\r\\non happy fortnights is highly ingenious, and the talobert skin made me\\r\\nlaugh a good deal. Whenever I fall into misfortune, how many jokes it\\r\\nought to furnish to my acquaintance in general, or I shall die\\r\\ndreadfully in their debt for entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began to occur to me before you mentioned it that I had been\\r\\nsomewhat silent as to my mother\\'s health for some time, but I thought\\r\\nyou could have no difficulty in divining its exact state,--you, who have\\r\\nguessed so much stranger things. She is tolerably well,--better upon the\\r\\nwhole than she was some weeks ago. She would tell you herself that she\\r\\nhas a very dreadful cold in her head at present; but I have not much\\r\\ncompassion for colds in the head without fever or sore throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur own particular little brother got a place in the coach last night,\\r\\nand is now, I suppose, in town. I have no objection at all to your\\r\\nbuying our gowns there, as your imagination has pictured to you exactly\\r\\nsuch a one as is necessary to make me happy. You quite abash me by your\\r\\nprogress in notting, for I am still without silk. You must get me some\\r\\nin town or in Canterbury; it should be finer than yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought Edward would not approve of Charles being a crop, and rather\\r\\nwished you to conceal it from him at present, lest it might fall on his\\r\\nspirits and retard his recovery. My father furnishes him with a pig from\\r\\nCheesedown; it is already killed and cut up, but it is not to weigh more\\r\\nthan nine stone; the season is too far advanced to get him a larger one.\\r\\nMy mother means to pay herself for the salt and the trouble of ordering\\r\\nit to be cured by the spareribs, the souse, and the lard. We have had\\r\\none dead lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\nI congratulate you on Mr. E. Hatton\\'s good fortune. I suppose the\\r\\nmarriage will now follow out of hand. Give my compliments to Miss Finch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat time in March may we expect your return in? I begin to be very\\r\\ntired of answering people\\'s questions on that subject, and independent\\r\\nof that, I shall be very glad to see you at home again, and then if we\\r\\ncan get Martha and shirk . . . who will be so happy as we?\\r\\n\\r\\nI think of going to Ibthorp in about a fortnight. My eyes are pretty\\r\\nwell, I thank you, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday, 23d._--I wish my dear Fanny many returns of this day, and\\r\\nthat she may on every return enjoy as much pleasure as she is now\\r\\nreceiving from her doll\\'s-beds.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just heard from Charles, who is by this time at Deal. He is to be\\r\\nsecond lieutenant, which pleases him very well. The \"Endymion\" is come\\r\\ninto the Downs, which pleases him likewise. He expects to be ordered to\\r\\nSheerness shortly, as the \"Tamar\" has never been refitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father and mother made the same match for you last night, and are\\r\\nvery much pleased with it. _He_ is a beauty of my mother\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                            Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                               JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    13 QUEEN\\'S SQUARE, Friday (May 17).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Our journey yesterday went off exceedingly well;\\r\\nnothing occurred to alarm or delay us. We found the roads in excellent\\r\\norder, had very good horses all the way, and reached Devizes with ease\\r\\nby four o\\'clock. I suppose John has told you in what manner we were\\r\\ndivided when we left Andover, and no alteration was afterwards made. At\\r\\nDevizes we had comfortable rooms and a good dinner, to which we sat down\\r\\nabout five; amongst other things we had asparagus and a lobster, which\\r\\nmade me wish for you, and some cheesecakes, on which the children made\\r\\nso delightful a supper as to endear the town of Devizes to them for a\\r\\nlong time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, here we are at Bath; we got here about one o\\'clock, and have been\\r\\narrived just long enough to go over the house, fix on our rooms, and be\\r\\nvery well pleased with the whole of it. Poor Elizabeth has had a dismal\\r\\nride of it from Devizes, for it has rained almost all the way, and our\\r\\nfirst view of Bath has been just as gloomy as it was last November\\r\\ntwelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have got so many things to say, so many things equally important, that\\r\\nI know not on which to decide at present, and shall therefore go and eat\\r\\nwith the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stopped in Paragon as we came along, but as it was too wet and dirty\\r\\nfor us to get out, we could only see Frank, who told us that his master\\r\\nwas very indifferent, but had had a better night last night than usual.\\r\\nIn Paragon we met Mrs. Foley and Mrs. Dowdeswell with her yellow shawl\\r\\nairing out, and at the bottom of Kingsdown Hill we met a gentleman in a\\r\\nbuggy, who, on minute examination, turned out to be Dr. Hall--and Dr.\\r\\nHall in such very deep mourning that either his mother, his wife, or\\r\\nhimself must be dead. These are all of our acquaintance who have yet met\\r\\nour eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have some hopes of being plagued about my trunk; I had more a few\\r\\nhours ago, for it was too heavy to go by the coach which brought Thomas\\r\\nand Rebecca from Devizes; there was reason to suppose that it might be\\r\\ntoo heavy likewise for any other coach, and for a long time we could\\r\\nhear of no wagon to convey it. At last, however, we unluckily discovered\\r\\nthat one was just on the point of setting out for this place, but at any\\r\\nrate the trunk cannot be here till to-morrow; so far we are safe, and\\r\\nwho knows what may not happen to procure a further delay?\\r\\n\\r\\nI put Mary\\'s letter into the post-office at Andover with my own hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are exceedingly pleased with the house; the rooms are quite as large\\r\\nas we expected. Mrs. Bromley is a fat woman in mourning, and a little\\r\\nblack kitten runs about the staircase. Elizabeth has the apartment\\r\\nwithin the drawing-room; she wanted my mother to have it, but as there\\r\\nwas no bed in the inner one, and the stairs are so much easier of\\r\\nascent, or my mother so much stronger than in Paragon as not to regard\\r\\nthe double flight, it is settled for us to be above, where we have two\\r\\nvery nice-sized rooms, with dirty quilts and everything comfortable. I\\r\\nhave the outward and larger apartment, as I ought to have; which is\\r\\nquite as large as our bedroom at home, and my mother\\'s is not materially\\r\\nless. The beds are both as large as any at Steventon, and I have a very\\r\\nnice chest of drawers and a closet full of shelves,--so full indeed that\\r\\nthere is nothing else in it, and it should therefore be called a\\r\\ncupboard rather than a closet, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell Mary that there were some carpenters at work in the inn at Devizes\\r\\nthis morning, but as I could not be sure of their being Mrs. W. Fowle\\'s\\r\\nrelations, I did not make myself known to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope it will be a tolerable afternoon. When first we came, all the\\r\\numbrellas were up, but now the pavements are getting very white again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother does not seem at all the worse for her journey, nor are any of\\r\\nus, I hope, though Edward seemed rather fagged last night, and not very\\r\\nbrisk this morning; but I trust the bustle of sending for tea, coffee,\\r\\nand sugar, etc., and going out to taste a cheese himself, will do him\\r\\ngood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a very long list of arrivals here in the newspaper yesterday,\\r\\nso that we need not immediately dread absolute solitude; and there is a\\r\\npublic breakfast in Sydney Gardens every morning, so that we shall not\\r\\nbe wholly starved.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth has just had a very good account of the three little boys. I\\r\\nhope you are very busy and very comfortable. I find no difficulty in\\r\\nclosing my eyes. I like our situation very much; it is far more cheerful\\r\\nthan Paragon, and the prospect from the drawing-room window, at which I\\r\\nnow write, is rather picturesque, as it commands a prospective view of\\r\\nthe left side of Brock Street, broken by three Lombardy poplars in the\\r\\ngarden of the last house in Queen\\'s Parade.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am rather impatient to know the fate of my best gown, but I suppose it\\r\\nwill be some days before Frances can get through the trunk. In the mean\\r\\ntime I am, with many thanks for your trouble in making it, as well as\\r\\nmarking my silk stockings,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                            JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great deal of love from everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    13 QUEEN SQUARE, Sunday (June 2).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I am obliged to you for two letters, one from\\r\\nyourself and the other from Mary, for of the latter I knew nothing till\\r\\non the receipt of yours yesterday, when the pigeon-basket was examined,\\r\\nand I received my due. As I have written to her since the time which\\r\\nought to have brought me hers, I suppose she will consider herself, as I\\r\\nchoose to consider her, still in my debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will lay out all the little judgment I have in endeavoring to get such\\r\\nstockings for Anna as she will approve; but I do not know that I shall\\r\\nexecute Martha\\'s commission at all, for I am not fond of ordering shoes;\\r\\nand, at any rate, they shall all have flat heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat must I tell you of Edward? Truth or falsehood? I will try the\\r\\nformer, and you may choose for yourself another time. He was better\\r\\nyesterday than he had been for two or three days before,--about as well\\r\\nas while he was at Steventon. He drinks at the Hetling Pump, is to bathe\\r\\nto-morrow, and try electricity on Tuesday. He proposed the latter\\r\\nhimself to Dr. Fellowes, who made no objection to it, but I fancy we are\\r\\nall unanimous in expecting no advantage from it. At present I have no\\r\\ngreat notion of our staying here beyond the month.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard from Charles last week; they were to sail on Wednesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother seems remarkably well. My uncle overwalked himself at first,\\r\\nand can now only travel in a chair, but is otherwise very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cloak is come home. I like it very much, and can now exclaim with\\r\\ndelight, like J. Bond at hay-harvest, \"This is what I have been looking\\r\\nfor these three years.\" I saw some gauzes in a shop in Bath Street\\r\\nyesterday at only 4_d._ a yard, but they were not so good or so pretty\\r\\nas mine. Flowers are very much worn, and fruit is still more the thing.\\r\\nElizabeth has a bunch of strawberries, and I have seen grapes, cherries,\\r\\nplums, and apricots. There are likewise almonds and raisins, French\\r\\nplums, and tamarinds at the grocers\\', but I have never seen any of them\\r\\nin hats. A plum or greengage would cost three shillings; cherries and\\r\\ngrapes about five, I believe, but this is at some of the dearest shops.\\r\\nMy aunt has told me of a very cheap one, near Walcot Church, to which I\\r\\nshall go in quest of something for you. I have never seen an old woman\\r\\nat the pump-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth has given me a hat, and it is not only a pretty hat, but a\\r\\npretty style of hat too. It is something like Eliza\\'s, only, instead of\\r\\nbeing all straw, half of it is narrow purple ribbon. I flatter myself,\\r\\nhowever, that you can understand very little of it from this\\r\\ndescription. Heaven forbid that I should ever offer such encouragement\\r\\nto explanations as to give a clear one on any occasion myself! But I\\r\\nmust write no more of this. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent Friday evening with the Mapletons, and was obliged to submit to\\r\\nbeing pleased in spite of my inclination. We took a very charming walk\\r\\nfrom six to eight up Beacon Hill, and across some fields, to the village\\r\\nof Charlecombe, which is sweetly situated in a little green valley, as a\\r\\nvillage with such a name ought to be. Marianne is sensible and\\r\\nintelligent; and even Jane, considering how fair she is, is not\\r\\nunpleasant. We had a Miss North and a Mr. Gould of our party; the latter\\r\\nwalked home with me after tea. He is a very young man, just entered\\r\\nOxford, wears spectacles, and has heard that \"Evelina\" was written by\\r\\nDr. Johnson.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am afraid I cannot undertake to carry Martha\\'s shoes home, for, though\\r\\nwe had plenty of room in our trunks when we came, we shall have many\\r\\nmore things to take back, and I must allow besides for my packing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is to be a grand gala on Tuesday evening in Sydney Gardens, a\\r\\nconcert, with illuminations and fireworks. To the latter Elizabeth and I\\r\\nlook forward with pleasure, and even the concert will have more than\\r\\nits usual charm for me, as the gardens are large enough for me to get\\r\\npretty well beyond the reach of its sound. In the morning Lady\\r\\nWilloughby is to present the colors to some corps, or Yeomanry, or\\r\\nother, in the Crescent, and that such festivities may have a proper\\r\\ncommencement, we think of going to. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nI am quite pleased with Martha and Mrs. Lefroy for wanting the pattern\\r\\nof our caps, but I am not so well pleased with your giving it to them.\\r\\nSome wish, some prevailing wish, is necessary to the animation of\\r\\neverybody\\'s mind, and in gratifying this you leave them to form some\\r\\nother which will not probably be half so innocent. I shall not forget to\\r\\nwrite to Frank. Duty and love, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle is quite surprised at my hearing from you so often; but as long\\r\\nas we can keep the frequency of our correspondence from Martha\\'s uncle,\\r\\nwe will not fear our own.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                13 QUEEN SQUARE, Tuesday (June 11).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter yesterday made me very happy. I am\\r\\nheartily glad that you have escaped any share in the impurities of\\r\\nDeane, and not sorry, as it turns out, that our stay here has been\\r\\nlengthened. I feel tolerably secure of our getting away next week,\\r\\nthough it is certainly possible that we may remain till Thursday the\\r\\n27th. I wonder what we shall do with all our intended visits this\\r\\nsummer! I should like to make a compromise with Adlestrop, Harden, and\\r\\nBookham, that Martha\\'s spending the summer at Steventon should be\\r\\nconsidered as our respective visits to them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward has been pretty well for this last week, and as the waters have\\r\\nnever disagreed with him in any respect, we are inclined to hope that he\\r\\nwill derive advantage from them in the end. Everybody encourages us in\\r\\nthis expectation, for they all say that the effect of the waters cannot\\r\\nbe negative, and many are the instances in which their benefit is felt\\r\\nafterwards more than on the spot. He is more comfortable here than I\\r\\nthought he would be, and so is Elizabeth, though they will both, I\\r\\nbelieve, be very glad to get away--the latter especially, which one\\r\\ncan\\'t wonder at somehow. So much for Mrs. Piozzi. I had some thoughts of\\r\\nwriting the whole of my letter in her style, but I believe I shall not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough you have given me unlimited powers concerning your sprig, I\\r\\ncannot determine what to do about it, and shall therefore in this and in\\r\\nevery other future letter continue to ask your further directions. We\\r\\nhave been to the cheap shop, and very cheap we found it, but there are\\r\\nonly flowers made there, no fruit; and as I could get four or five very\\r\\npretty sprigs of the former for the same money which would procure only\\r\\none Orleans plum--in short, could get more for three or four shillings\\r\\nthan I could have means of bringing home--I cannot decide on the fruit\\r\\ntill I hear from you again. Besides, I cannot help thinking that it is\\r\\nmore natural to have flowers grow out of the head than fruit. What do\\r\\nyou think on that subject?\\r\\n\\r\\nI would not let Martha read \"First Impressions\"[4] again upon any\\r\\naccount, and am very glad that I did not leave it in your power. She is\\r\\nvery cunning, but I saw through her design; she means to publish it from\\r\\nmemory, and one more perusal must enable her to do it. As for\\r\\n\"Fitzalbini,\" when I get home she shall have it, as soon as ever she\\r\\nwill own that Mr. Elliott is handsomer than Mr. Lance, that fair men are\\r\\npreferable to black; for I mean to take every opportunity of rooting out\\r\\nher prejudices.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Portal is here. How charming that is! I do not exactly know\\r\\nwhy, but the phrase followed so naturally that I could not help putting\\r\\nit down. My mother saw him the other day, but without making herself\\r\\nknown to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very glad you liked my lace, and so are you, and so is Martha, and\\r\\nwe are all glad together. I have got your cloak home, which is quite\\r\\ndelightful,--as delightful at least as half the circumstances which are\\r\\ncalled so.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know what is the matter with me to-day, but I cannot write\\r\\nquietly; I am always wandering away into some exclamation or other.\\r\\nFortunately I have nothing very particular to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked to Weston one evening last week, and liked it very much. Liked\\r\\nwhat very much? Weston? No, walking to Weston. I have not expressed\\r\\nmyself properly, but I hope you will understand me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have not been to any public place lately, nor performed anything out\\r\\nof the common daily routine of No. 13 Queen Square, Bath. But to-day we\\r\\nwere to have dashed away at a very extraordinary rate, by dining out,\\r\\nhad it not so happened that we did not go.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward renewed his acquaintance lately with Mr. Evelyn, who lives in the\\r\\nQueen\\'s Parade, and was invited to a family dinner, which I believe at\\r\\nfirst Elizabeth was rather sorry at his accepting; but yesterday Mrs.\\r\\nEvelyn called on us, and her manners were so pleasing that we liked the\\r\\nidea of going very much. The Biggs would call her a nice woman. But Mr.\\r\\nEvelyn, who was indisposed yesterday, is worse to-day, and we are put\\r\\noff.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is rather impertinent to suggest any household care to a housekeeper,\\r\\nbut I just venture to say that the coffee-mill will be wanted every day\\r\\nwhile Edward is at Steventon, as he always drinks coffee for breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny desires her love to you, her love to grandpapa, her love to Anna,\\r\\nand her love to Hannah; the latter is particularly to be remembered.\\r\\nEdward desires his love to you, to grandpapa, to Anna, to little Edward,\\r\\nto Aunt James and Uncle James, and he hopes all your turkeys and ducks\\r\\nand chicken and guinea fowls are very well; and he wishes you very much\\r\\nto send him a printed letter, and so does Fanny--and they both rather\\r\\nthink they shall answer it. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Gardiner was married yesterday to Mrs. Percy and her three\\r\\ndaughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I will give you the history of Mary\\'s veil, in the purchase of which\\r\\nI have so considerably involved you that it is my duty to economize for\\r\\nyou in the flowers. I had no difficulty in getting a muslin veil for\\r\\nhalf a guinea, and not much more in discovering afterwards that the\\r\\nmuslin was thick, dirty, and ragged, and therefore would by no means do\\r\\nfor a united gift. I changed it consequently as soon as I could, and,\\r\\nconsidering what a state my imprudence had reduced me to, I thought\\r\\nmyself lucky in getting a black lace one for sixteen shillings. I hope\\r\\nthe half of that sum will not greatly exceed what you had intended to\\r\\noffer upon the altar of sister-in-law affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey do not seem to trouble you much from Manydown. I have long wanted\\r\\nto quarrel with them, and I believe I shall take this opportunity. There\\r\\nis no denying that they are very capricious--for they like to enjoy\\r\\ntheir elder sister\\'s company when they can.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[4] The title first chosen for \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                 STEVENTON, Thursday (November 20, 1800).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter took me quite by surprise this morning;\\r\\nyou are very welcome, however, and I am very much obliged to you. I\\r\\nbelieve I drank too much wine last night at Hurstbourne; I know not how\\r\\nelse to account for the shaking of my hand to-day. You will kindly make\\r\\nallowance therefore for any indistinctness of writing, by attributing it\\r\\nto this venial error.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaughty Charles did not come on Tuesday, but good Charles came yesterday\\r\\nmorning. About two o\\'clock he walked in on a Gosport hack. His feeling\\r\\nequal to such a fatigue is a good sign, and his feeling no fatigue in it\\r\\na still better. He walked down to Deane to dinner; he danced the whole\\r\\nevening, and to-day is no more tired than a gentleman ought to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour desiring to hear from me on Sunday will, perhaps, bring you a more\\r\\nparticular account of the ball than you may care for, because one is\\r\\nprone to think much more of such things the morning after they happen,\\r\\nthan when time has entirely driven them out of one\\'s recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a pleasant evening; Charles found it remarkably so, but I cannot\\r\\ntell why, unless the absence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience\\r\\nreproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent, was a relief to\\r\\nhim. There were only twelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was\\r\\nmerely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner. We\\r\\nbegan at ten, supped at one, and were at Deane before five. There were\\r\\nbut fifty people in the room; very few families indeed from our side of\\r\\nthe county, and not many more from the other. My partners were the two\\r\\nSt. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and a very prodigious Mr. Mathew, with whom I\\r\\ncalled the last, and whom I liked the best of my little stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were very few beauties, and such as there were were not very\\r\\nhandsome. Miss Iremonger did not look well, and Mrs. Blount was the\\r\\nonly one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September,\\r\\nwith the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband,\\r\\nand fat neck. The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains\\r\\nof the vulgar, broad-featured girl who danced at Enham eight years ago;\\r\\nthe other is refined into a nice, composed-looking girl, like Catherine\\r\\nBigg. I looked at Sir Thomas Champneys, and thought of poor Rosalie; I\\r\\nlooked at his daughter, and thought her a queer animal with a white\\r\\nneck. Mrs. Warren I was constrained to think a very fine young woman,\\r\\nwhich I much regret. She danced away with great activity. Her husband is\\r\\nugly enough, uglier even than his cousin John; but he does not look so\\r\\n_very_ old. The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish, very like Anne, with\\r\\nbrown skins, large dark eyes, and a good deal of nose. The General has\\r\\ngot the gout, and Mrs. Maitland the jaundice. Miss Debary, Susan, and\\r\\nSally, all in black, but without any statues, made their appearance, and\\r\\nI was as civil to them as circumstances would allow me. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nMary said that I looked very well last night. I wore my aunt\\'s gown and\\r\\nhandkerchief, and my hair was at least tidy, which was all my ambition.\\r\\nI will now have done with the ball, and I will moreover go and dress for\\r\\ndinner. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nFarewell; Charles sends you his best love, and Edward his worst. If you\\r\\nthink the distinction improper, you may take the worst yourself. He\\r\\nwill write to you when he gets back to his ship, and in the mean time\\r\\ndesires that you will consider me as\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Your affectionate sister,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friday._--I have determined to go on Thursday, but of course not before\\r\\nthe post comes in. Charles is in very good looks indeed. I had the\\r\\ncomfort of finding out the other evening who all the fat girls with long\\r\\nnoses were that disturbed me at the First H. ball. They all proved to be\\r\\nMiss Atkinsons of En--[_illegible_].\\r\\n\\r\\nI rejoice to say that we have just had another letter from our dear\\r\\nFrank. It is to you, very short, written from Larnica in Cyprus, and so\\r\\nlately as October 2. He came from Alexandria, and was to return there in\\r\\nthree or four days, knew nothing of his promotion, and does not write\\r\\nabove twenty lines, from a doubt of the letter\\'s ever reaching you, and\\r\\nan idea of all letters being opened at Vienna. He wrote a few days\\r\\nbefore to you from Alexandria by the \"Mercury,\" sent with despatches to\\r\\nLord Keith. Another letter must be owing to us besides this, one if not\\r\\ntwo; because none of these are to me. Henry comes to-morrow, for one\\r\\nnight only.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother has heard from Mrs. E. Leigh. Lady Saye and Seale and her\\r\\ndaughter are going to remove to Bath. Mrs. Estwick is married again to\\r\\na Mr. Sloane, a young man under age, without the knowledge of either\\r\\nfamily. He bears a good character, however.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                 STEVENTON, Saturday (January 3, 1801).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--As you have by this time received my last letter, it\\r\\nis fit that I should begin another; and I begin with the hope, which is\\r\\nat present uppermost in my mind, that you often wore a white gown in the\\r\\nmorning at the time of all the gay parties being with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visit at Ash Park, last Wednesday, went off in a _come-c\\xc3\\xa1_ way. We\\r\\nmet Mr. Lefroy and Tom Chute, played at cards, and came home again.\\r\\nJames and Mary dined here on the following day, and at night Henry set\\r\\noff in the mail for London. He was as agreeable as ever during his\\r\\nvisit, and has not lost anything in Miss Lloyd\\'s estimation.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday we were quite alone--only our four selves; but to-day the\\r\\nscene is agreeably varied by Mary\\'s driving Martha to Basingstoke, and\\r\\nMartha\\'s afterwards dining at Deane.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother looks forward with as much certainty as you can do to our\\r\\nkeeping two maids; my father is the only one not in the secret. We plan\\r\\nhaving a steady cook and a young giddy housemaid, with a sedate,\\r\\nmiddle-aged man, who is to undertake the double office of husband to the\\r\\nformer and sweetheart to the latter. No children of course to be allowed\\r\\non either side.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou feel more for John Bond than John Bond deserves. I am sorry to lower\\r\\nhis character, but he is not ashamed to own himself that he has no doubt\\r\\nat all of getting a good place, and that he had even an offer many years\\r\\nago from a Farmer Paine of taking him into his service whenever he might\\r\\nquit my father\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three parts of Bath which we have thought of as likely to have\\r\\nhouses in them,--Westgate Buildings, Charles Street, and some of the\\r\\nshort streets leading from Laura Place or Pulteney Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nWestgate Buildings, though quite in the lower part of the town, are not\\r\\nbadly situated themselves. The street is broad, and has rather a good\\r\\nappearance. Charles Street, however, I think is preferable. The\\r\\nbuildings are new, and its nearness to Kingsmead Fields would be a\\r\\npleasant circumstance. Perhaps you may remember, or perhaps you may\\r\\nforget, that Charles Street leads from the Queen Square Chapel to the\\r\\ntwo Green Park Streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe houses in the streets near Laura Place I should expect to be above\\r\\nour price. Gay Street would be too high, except only the lower house on\\r\\nthe left-hand side as you ascend. Towards that my mother has no\\r\\ndisinclination; it used to be lower rented than any other house in the\\r\\nrow, from some inferiority in the apartments. But above all others her\\r\\nwishes are at present fixed on the corner house in Chapel Row, which\\r\\nopens into Prince\\'s Street. Her knowledge of it, however, is confined\\r\\nonly to the outside, and therefore she is equally uncertain of its being\\r\\nreally desirable as of its being to be had. In the mean time she assures\\r\\nyou that she will do everything in her power to avoid Trim Street,\\r\\nalthough you have not expressed the fearful presentiment of it which was\\r\\nrather expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that Mrs. Perrot will want to get us into Oxford Buildings, but\\r\\nwe all unite in particular dislike of that part of the town, and\\r\\ntherefore hope to escape. Upon all these different situations you and\\r\\nEdward may confer together, and your opinion of each will be expected\\r\\nwith eagerness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to our pictures, the battle-piece, Mr. Nibbs, Sir William East, and\\r\\nall the old heterogeneous, miscellany, manuscript, Scriptural pieces\\r\\ndispersed over the house, are to be given to James. Your own drawings\\r\\nwill not cease to be your own, and the two paintings on tin will be at\\r\\nyour disposal. My mother says that the French agricultural prints in\\r\\nthe best bedroom were given by Edward to his two sisters. Do you or he\\r\\nknow anything about it?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has written to my aunt, and we are all impatient for the answer. I\\r\\ndo not know how to give up the idea of our both going to Paragon in May.\\r\\nYour going I consider as indispensably necessary, and I shall not like\\r\\nbeing left behind; there is no place here or hereabouts that I shall\\r\\nwant to be staying at, and though, to be sure, the keep of two will be\\r\\nmore than of one, I will endeavor to make the difference less by\\r\\ndisordering my stomach with Bath buns; and as to the trouble of\\r\\naccommodating us, whether there are one or two, it is much the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the first plan, my mother and our two selves are to travel\\r\\ndown together, and my father follow us afterwards in about a fortnight\\r\\nor three weeks. We have promised to spend a couple of days at Ibthorp in\\r\\nour way. We must all meet at Bath, you know, before we set out for the\\r\\nsea, and, everything considered, I think the first plan as good as any.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father and mother, wisely aware of the difficulty of finding in all\\r\\nBath such a bed as their own, have resolved on taking it with them; all\\r\\nthe beds, indeed, that we shall want are to be removed,--namely, besides\\r\\ntheirs, our own two, the best for a spare one, and two for servants; and\\r\\nthese necessary articles will probably be the only material ones that\\r\\nit would answer to send down. I do not think it will be worth while to\\r\\nremove any of our chests of drawers; we shall be able to get some of a\\r\\nmuch more commodious sort, made of deal, and painted to look very neat;\\r\\nand I flatter myself that for little comforts of all kinds our apartment\\r\\nwill be one of the most complete things of the sort all over Bath,\\r\\nBristol included.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have thought at times of removing the sideboard, or a Pembroke table,\\r\\nor some other piece of furniture, but, upon the whole, it has ended in\\r\\nthinking that the trouble and risk of the removal would be more than the\\r\\nadvantage of having them at a place where everything may be purchased.\\r\\nPray send your opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha has as good as promised to come to us again in March. Her spirits\\r\\nare better than they were. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother bargains for having no trouble at all in furnishing our house\\r\\nin Bath, and I have engaged for your willingly undertaking to do it all.\\r\\nI get more and more reconciled to the idea of our removal. We have lived\\r\\nlong enough in this neighborhood: the Basingstoke balls are certainly on\\r\\nthe decline, there is something interesting in the bustle of going away,\\r\\nand the prospect of spending future summers by the sea or in Wales is\\r\\nvery delightful. For a time we shall now possess many of the advantages\\r\\nwhich I have often thought of with envy in the wives of sailors or\\r\\nsoldiers. It must not be generally known, however, that I am not\\r\\nsacrificing a great deal in quitting the country, or I can expect to\\r\\ninspire no tenderness, no interest, in those we leave behind. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours affectionately,       J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    STEVENTON, Thursday (January 8).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--The \"perhaps\" which concluded my last letter being\\r\\nonly a \"perhaps,\" will not occasion your being overpowered with\\r\\nsurprise, I dare say, if you should receive this before Tuesday, which,\\r\\nunless circumstances are very perverse, will be the case. I received\\r\\nyours with much general philanthropy, and still more peculiar good-will,\\r\\ntwo days ago; and I suppose I need not tell you that it was very long,\\r\\nbeing written on a foolscap sheet, and very entertaining, being written\\r\\nby you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Payne has been dead long enough for Henry to be out of mourning for\\r\\nhim before his last visit, though we knew nothing of it till about that\\r\\ntime. Why he died, or of what complaint, or to what noblemen he\\r\\nbequeathed his four daughters in marriage, we have not heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad that the Wildmans are going to give a ball, and hope you will\\r\\nnot fail to benefit both yourself and me by laying out a few kisses in\\r\\nthe purchase of a frank. I believe you are right in proposing to delay\\r\\nthe cambric muslin, and I submit with a kind of voluntary reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Peter Debary has declined Deane curacy; he wishes to be settled near\\r\\nLondon. A foolish reason! as if Deane were not near London in comparison\\r\\nof Exeter or York. Take the whole world through, and he will find many\\r\\nmore places at a greater distance from London than Deane than he will at\\r\\na less. What does he think of Glencoe or Lake Katherine?\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel rather indignant that any possible objection should be raised\\r\\nagainst so valuable a piece of preferment, so delightful a\\r\\nsituation!--that Deane should not be universally allowed to be as near\\r\\nthe metropolis as any other country villages. As this is the case,\\r\\nhowever, as Mr. Peter Debary has shown himself a Peter in the blackest\\r\\nsense of the word, we are obliged to look elsewhere for an heir; and my\\r\\nfather has thought it a necessary compliment to James Digweed to offer\\r\\nthe curacy to him, though without considering it as either a desirable\\r\\nor an eligible situation for him. Unless he is in love with Miss Lyford,\\r\\nI think he had better not be settled exactly in this neighborhood; and\\r\\nunless he is very much in love with her indeed, he is not likely to\\r\\nthink a salary of 50_l._ equal in value or efficiency to one of 75_l._\\r\\n\\r\\nWere you indeed to be considered as one of the fixtures of the\\r\\nhouse!--but you were never actually erected in it either by Mr. Egerton\\r\\nBrydges or Mrs. Lloyd. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are very kind in planning presents for me to make, and my mother has\\r\\nshown me exactly the same attention; but as I do not choose to have\\r\\ngenerosity dictated to me, I shall not resolve on giving my cabinet to\\r\\nAnna till the first thought of it has been my own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSidmouth is now talked of as our summer abode. Get all the information,\\r\\ntherefore, about it that you can from Mrs. C. Cage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father\\'s old ministers are already deserting him to pay their court\\r\\nto his son. The brown mare, which, as well as the black, was to devolve\\r\\non James at our removal, has not had patience to wait for that, and has\\r\\nsettled herself even now at Deane. The death of Hugh Capet, which, like\\r\\nthat of Mr. Skipsey, though undesired, was not wholly unexpected, being\\r\\npurposely effected, has made the immediate possession of the mare very\\r\\nconvenient, and everything else I suppose will be seized by degrees in\\r\\nthe same manner. Martha and I work at the books every day.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours affectionately,       J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    STEVENTON, Wednesday (January 14).\\r\\n\\r\\nPOOR Miss Austen! It appears to me that I have rather oppressed you of\\r\\nlate by the frequency of my letters. You had hoped not to hear from me\\r\\nagain before Tuesday, but Sunday showed you with what a merciless sister\\r\\nyou had to deal. I cannot recall the past, but you shall not hear from\\r\\nme quite so often in future.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour letter to Mary was duly received before she left Deane with Martha\\r\\nyesterday morning, and it gives us great pleasure to know that the\\r\\nChilham ball was so agreeable, and that you danced four dances with Mr.\\r\\nKemble. Desirable, however, as the latter circumstance was, I cannot\\r\\nhelp wondering at its taking place. Why did you dance four dances with\\r\\nso stupid a man? Why not rather dance two of them with some elegant\\r\\nbrother officer who was struck with your appearance as soon as you\\r\\nentered the room?\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha left you her best love. She will write to you herself in a short\\r\\ntime; but trusting to my memory rather than her own, she has\\r\\nnevertheless desired me to ask you to purchase for her two bottles of\\r\\nSteele\\'s lavender water when you are in town, provided you should go to\\r\\nthe shop on your own account, otherwise you may be sure that she would\\r\\nnot have you recollect the request.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames dined with us yesterday, wrote to Edward in the evening, filled\\r\\nthree sides of paper, every line inclining too much towards the\\r\\nnortheast, and the very first line of all scratched out, and this\\r\\nmorning he joins his lady in the fields of Elysium and Ibthorp.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast Friday was a very busy day with us. We were visited by Miss Lyford\\r\\nand Mr. Bayle. The latter began his operations in the house, but had\\r\\nonly time to finish the four sitting-rooms; the rest is deferred till\\r\\nthe spring is more advanced and the days longer. He took his paper of\\r\\nappraisement away with him, and therefore we only know the estimate he\\r\\nhas made of one or two articles of furniture which my father\\r\\nparticularly inquired into. I understand, however, that he was of\\r\\nopinion that the whole would amount to more than two hundred pounds, and\\r\\nit is not imagined that this will comprehend the brewhouse and many\\r\\nother, etc., etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Lyford was very pleasant, and gave my mother such an account of the\\r\\nhouses in Westgate Buildings, where Mrs. Lyford lodged four years ago,\\r\\nas made her think of a situation there with great pleasure, but your\\r\\nopposition will be without difficulty decisive, and my father, in\\r\\nparticular, who was very well inclined towards the Row before, has now\\r\\nceased to think of it entirely. At present the environs of Laura Place\\r\\nseem to be his choice. His views on the subject are much advanced since\\r\\nI came home; he grows quite ambitious, and actually requires now a\\r\\ncomfortable and a creditable-looking house.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday Miss Lyford went to her long home,--that is to say, it was a\\r\\nlong way off,--and soon afterwards a party of fine ladies issuing from a\\r\\nwell-known commodious green vehicle, their heads full of Bantam cocks\\r\\nand Galinies, entered the house,--Mrs. Heathcote, Mrs. Harwood, Mrs.\\r\\nJames Austen, Miss Bigg, Miss Jane Blachford.\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly a day passes in which we do not have some visitor or other:\\r\\nyesterday came Mrs. Bramstone, who is very sorry that she is to lose us,\\r\\nand afterwards Mr. Holder, who was shut up for an hour with my father\\r\\nand James in a most awful manner. John Bond _est \\xc3\\xa0 lui_. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    STEVENTON, Wednesday (January 21).\\r\\n\\r\\nEXPECT a most agreeable letter, for not being overburdened with subject\\r\\n(having nothing at all to say), I shall have no check to my genius from\\r\\nbeginning to end.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, and so Prank\\'s letter has made you very happy, but you are afraid\\r\\nhe would not have patience to stay for the \"Haarlem,\" which you wish him\\r\\nto have done as being safer than the merchantman. Poor fellow! to wait\\r\\nfrom the middle of November to the end of December, and perhaps even\\r\\nlonger, it must be sad work; especially in a place where the ink is so\\r\\nabominably pale. What a surprise to him it must have been on October 20,\\r\\nto be visited, collared, and thrust out of the \"Petterel\" by Captain\\r\\nInglis. He kindly passes over the poignancy of his feelings in quitting\\r\\nhis ship, his officers, and his men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a pity it is that he should not be in England at the time of this\\r\\npromotion, because he certainly would have had an appointment, so\\r\\neverybody says, and therefore it must be right for me to say it too. Had\\r\\nhe been really here, the certainty of the appointment, I dare say, would\\r\\nnot have been half so great, but as it could not be brought to the\\r\\nproof, his absence will be always a lucky source of regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nEliza talks of having read in a newspaper that all the first lieutenants\\r\\nof the frigates whose captains were to be sent into line-of-battle ships\\r\\nwere to be promoted to the rank of commanders. If it be true, Mr.\\r\\nValentine may afford himself a fine Valentine\\'s knot, and Charles may\\r\\nperhaps become first of the \"Endymion,\" though I suppose Captain Durham\\r\\nis too likely to bring a villain with him under that denomination. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood have quite recovered the death of Mrs. Rider,--so much\\r\\nso, that I think they are rather rejoiced at it now; her things were so\\r\\nvery dear! and Mrs. Rogers is to be all that is desirable. Not even\\r\\ndeath itself can fix the friendship of the world. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wylmots being robbed must be an amusing thing to their acquaintance,\\r\\nand I hope it is as much their pleasure as it seems their avocation to\\r\\nbe subjects of general entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a great mind not to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, which\\r\\nI have just had the pleasure of reading, because I am so ashamed to\\r\\ncompare the sprawling lines of this with it. But if I say all that I\\r\\nhave to say, I hope I have no reason to hang myself. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy did not J. D. make his proposals to you? I suppose he went to see\\r\\nthe cathedral, that he might know how he should like to be married in\\r\\nit. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                               SOUTHAMPTON, Wednesday (January 7, 1807).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--You were mistaken in supposing I should expect your\\r\\nletter on Sunday; I had no idea of hearing from you before Tuesday, and\\r\\nmy pleasure yesterday was therefore unhurt by any previous\\r\\ndisappointment. I thank you for writing so much; you must really have\\r\\nsent me the value of two letters in one. We are extremely glad to hear\\r\\nthat Elizabeth is so much better, and hope you will be sensible of still\\r\\nfurther amendment in her when you return from Canterbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf your visit there I must now speak \"incessantly;\" it surprises, but\\r\\npleases me more, and I consider it as a very just and honorable\\r\\ndistinction of you, and not less to the credit of Mrs. Knight. I have no\\r\\ndoubt of your spending your time with her most pleasantly in quiet and\\r\\nrational conversation, and am so far from thinking her expectations of\\r\\nyou will be deceived, that my only fear is of your being so agreeable,\\r\\nso much to her taste, as to make her wish to keep you with her forever.\\r\\nIf that should be the case, we must remove to Canterbury, which I should\\r\\nnot like so well as Southampton.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you receive this, our guests will be all gone or going; and I shall\\r\\nbe left to the comfortable disposal of my time, to ease of mind from the\\r\\ntorments of rice puddings and apple dumplings, and probably to regret\\r\\nthat I did not take more pains to please them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. J. Austen has asked me to return with her to Steventon; I need not\\r\\ngive my answer; and she has invited my mother to spend there the time of\\r\\nMrs. F. A.\\'s confinement, which she seems half inclined to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days ago I had a letter from Miss Irvine, and as I was in her\\r\\ndebt, you will guess it to be a remonstrance, not a very severe one,\\r\\nhowever; the first page is in her usual retrospective, jealous,\\r\\ninconsistent style, but the remainder is chatty and harmless. She\\r\\nsupposes my silence may have proceeded from resentment of her not having\\r\\nwritten to inquire particularly after my hooping-cough, etc. She is a\\r\\nfunny one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have answered her letter, and have endeavored to give something like\\r\\nthe truth with as little incivility as I could, by placing my silence to\\r\\nthe want of subject in the very quiet way in which we live. Phebe has\\r\\nrepented, and stays. I have also written to Charles, and I answered Miss\\r\\nBuller\\'s letter by return of post, as I intended to tell you in my last.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo or three things I recollected when it was too late, that I might\\r\\nhave told you; one is that the Welbys have lost their eldest son by a\\r\\nputrid fever at Eton, and another that Tom Chute is going to settle in\\r\\nNorfolk.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have scarcely ever mentioned Lizzy since your being at Godmersham. I\\r\\nhope it is not because she is altered for the worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot yet satisfy Fanny as to Mrs. Foote\\'s baby\\'s name, and I must\\r\\nnot encourage her to expect a good one, as Captain Foote is a professed\\r\\nadversary to all but the plainest; he likes only Mary, Elizabeth, Anne,\\r\\netc. Our best chance is of \"Caroline,\" which in compliment to a sister\\r\\nseems the only exception.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dined with us on Friday, and I fear will not soon venture again, for\\r\\nthe strength of our dinner was a boiled leg of mutton, underdone even\\r\\nfor James; and Captain Foote has a particular dislike to underdone\\r\\nmutton; but he was so good-humored and pleasant that I did not much mind\\r\\nhis being starved. He gives us all the most cordial invitation to his\\r\\nhouse in the country, saying just what the Williams ought to say to make\\r\\nus welcome. Of them we have seen nothing since you left us, and we hear\\r\\nthat they are just gone to Bath again, to be out of the way of further\\r\\nalterations at Brooklands.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. F. A. has had a very agreeable letter from Mrs. Dickson, who was\\r\\ndelighted with the purse, and desires her not to provide herself with a\\r\\nchristening dress, which is exactly what her young correspondent wanted;\\r\\nand she means to defer making any of the caps as long as she can, in\\r\\nhope of having Mrs. D.\\'s present in time to be serviceable as a pattern.\\r\\nShe desires me to tell you that the gowns were cut out before your\\r\\nletter arrived, but that they are long enough for Caroline. The _Beds_,\\r\\nas I believe they are called, have fallen to Frank\\'s share to continue,\\r\\nand of course are cut out to admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alphonsine\" did not do. We were disgusted in twenty pages, as,\\r\\nindependent of a bad translation, it has indelicacies which disgrace a\\r\\npen hitherto so pure; and we changed it for the \"Female Quixote,\" which\\r\\nnow makes our evening amusement; to me a very high one, as I find the\\r\\nwork quite equal to what I remembered it. Mrs. F. A., to whom it is new,\\r\\nenjoys it as one could wish; the other Mary, I believe, has little\\r\\npleasure from that or any other book.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother does not seem at all more disappointed than ourselves at the\\r\\ntermination of the family treaty; she thinks less of that just now than\\r\\nof the comfortable state of her own finances, which she finds on closing\\r\\nher year\\'s accounts beyond her expectation, as she begins the new year\\r\\nwith a balance of 30_l._ in her favor; and when she has written her\\r\\nanswer to my aunt, which you know always hangs a little upon her mind,\\r\\nshe will be above the world entirely. You will have a great deal of\\r\\nunreserved discourse with Mrs. K., I dare say, upon this subject, as\\r\\nwell as upon many other of our family matters. Abuse everybody but me.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Thursday._--We expected James yesterday, but he did not come; if he\\r\\ncomes at all now, his visit will be a very short one, as he must return\\r\\nto-morrow, that Ajax and the chair may be sent to Winchester on\\r\\nSaturday. Caroline\\'s new pelisse depended upon her mother\\'s being able\\r\\nor not to come so far in the chair; how the guinea that will be saved by\\r\\nthe same means of return is to be spent I know not. Mrs. J. A. does not\\r\\ntalk much of poverty now, though she has no hope of my brother\\'s being\\r\\nable to buy another horse next summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir scheme against Warwickshire continues, but I doubt the family\\'s\\r\\nbeing at Stoneleigh so early as James says he must go, which is May.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother is afraid I have not been explicit enough on the subject of\\r\\nher wealth; she began 1806 with 68_l._ she begins 1807 with 99_l._, and\\r\\nthis after 32_l._ purchase of stock. Frank too has been settling his\\r\\naccounts and making calculations, and each party feels quite equal to\\r\\nour present expenses; but much increase of house-rent would not do for\\r\\neither. Frank limits himself, I believe, to four hundred a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will be surprised to hear that Jenny is not yet come back; we have\\r\\nheard nothing of her since her reaching Itchingswell, and can only\\r\\nsuppose that she must be detained by illness in somebody or other, and\\r\\nthat she has been each day expecting to be able to come on the morrow. I\\r\\nam glad I did not know beforehand that she was to be absent during the\\r\\nwhole or almost the whole of our friends being with us, for though the\\r\\ninconvenience has not been nothing, I should have feared still more.\\r\\nOur dinners have certainly suffered not a little by having only Molly\\'s\\r\\nhead and Molly\\'s hands to conduct them; she fries better than she did,\\r\\nbut not like Jenny.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did _not_ take our walk on Friday, it was too dirty, nor have we yet\\r\\ndone it; we may perhaps do something like it to-day, as after seeing\\r\\nFrank skate, which he hopes to do in the meadows by the beech, we are to\\r\\ntreat ourselves with a passage over the ferry. It is one of the\\r\\npleasantest frosts I ever knew, so very quiet. I hope it will last some\\r\\ntime longer for Frank\\'s sake, who is quite anxious to get some skating;\\r\\nhe tried yesterday, but it would not do.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur acquaintance increase too fast. He was recognized lately by Admiral\\r\\nBertie, and a few days since arrived the Admiral and his daughter\\r\\nCatherine to wait upon us. There was nothing to like or dislike in\\r\\neither. To the Berties are to be added the Lances, with whose cards we\\r\\nhave been endowed, and whose visit Frank and I returned yesterday. They\\r\\nlive about a mile and three-quarters from S. to the right of the new\\r\\nroad to Portsmouth, and I believe their house is one of those which are\\r\\nto be seen almost anywhere among the woods on the other side of the\\r\\nItchen. It is a handsome building, stands high, and in a very beautiful\\r\\nsituation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found only Mrs. Lance at home, and whether she boasts any offspring\\r\\nbesides a grand pianoforte did not appear. She was civil and chatty\\r\\nenough, and offered to introduce us to some acquaintance in Southampton,\\r\\nwhich we gratefully declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose they must be acting by the orders of Mr. Lance of Netherton in\\r\\nthis civility, as there seems no other reason for their coming near us.\\r\\nThey will not come often, I dare say. They live in a handsome style and\\r\\nare rich, and she seemed to like to be rich, and we gave her to\\r\\nunderstand that we were far from being so; she will soon feel therefore\\r\\nthat we are not worth her acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must have heard from Martha by this time. We have had no accounts of\\r\\nKintbury since her letter to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. F. A. has had one fainting fit lately; it came on as usual after\\r\\neating a hearty dinner, but did not last long.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can recollect nothing more to say. When my letter is gone, I suppose I\\r\\nshall.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just asked Caroline if I should send her love to her godmamma, to\\r\\nwhich she answered \"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                              SOUTHAMPTON, February 8.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . OUR garden is putting in order by a man who bears a remarkably\\r\\ngood character, has a very fine complexion, and asks something less than\\r\\nthe first. The shrubs which border the gravel walk, he says, are only\\r\\nsweetbrier and roses, and the latter of an indifferent sort; we mean to\\r\\nget a few of a better kind, therefore, and at my own particular desire\\r\\nhe procures us some syringas. I could not do without a syringa, for the\\r\\nsake of Cowper\\'s line. We talk also of a laburnum. The border under the\\r\\nterrace wall is clearing away to receive currants and gooseberry bushes,\\r\\nand a spot is found very proper for raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alterations and improvements within doors, too, advance very\\r\\nproperly, and the offices will be made very convenient indeed. Our\\r\\ndressing-table is constructing on the spot, out of a large kitchen table\\r\\nbelonging to the house, for doing which we have the permission of Mr.\\r\\nHusket, Lord Lansdown\\'s painter,--domestic painter, I should call him,\\r\\nfor he lives in the castle. Domestic chaplains have given way to this\\r\\nmore necessary office, and I suppose whenever the walls want no touching\\r\\nup he is employed about my lady\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning was so wet that I was afraid we should not be able to see\\r\\nour little visitor; but Frank, who alone could go to church, called for\\r\\nher after service, and she is now talking away at my side and examining\\r\\nthe treasures of my writing-desk drawers,--very happy, I believe. Not at\\r\\nall shy, of course. Her name is Catherine, and her sister\\'s Caroline.\\r\\nShe is something like her brother, and as short for her age, but not so\\r\\nwell-looking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is become of all the shyness in the world? Moral as well as natural\\r\\ndiseases disappear in the progress of time, and new ones take their\\r\\nplace. Shyness and the sweating sickness have given way to confidence\\r\\nand paralytic complaints. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n_Evening._--Our little visitor has just left us, and left us highly\\r\\npleased with her; she is a nice, natural, open-hearted, affectionate\\r\\ngirl, with all the ready civility which one sees in the best children in\\r\\nthe present day; so unlike anything that I was myself at her age, that I\\r\\nam often all astonishment and shame. Half her time was spent at\\r\\nspillikins, which I consider as a very valuable part of our household\\r\\nfurniture, and as not the least important benefaction from the family of\\r\\nKnight to that of Austen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I must tell you a story. Mary has for some time had notice from Mrs.\\r\\nDickson of the intended arrival of a certain Miss Fowler in this place.\\r\\nMiss F. is an intimate friend of Mrs. D., and a good deal known as such\\r\\nto Mary. On Thursday last she called here while we were out. Mary\\r\\nfound, on our return, her card with only her name on it, and she had\\r\\nleft word that she would call again. The particularity of this made us\\r\\ntalk, and, among other conjectures, Frank said in joke, \"I dare say she\\r\\nis staying with the Pearsons.\" The connection of the names struck Mary,\\r\\nand she immediately recollected Miss Fowler\\'s having been very intimate\\r\\nwith persons so called, and, upon putting everything together, we have\\r\\nscarcely a doubt of her being actually staying with the only family in\\r\\nthe place whom we cannot visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a _contretemps_! in the language of France. What an unluckiness! in\\r\\nthat of Madame Duval. The black gentleman has certainly employed one of\\r\\nhis menial imps to bring about this complete, though trifling mischief.\\r\\nMiss F. has never called again, but we are in daily expectation of it.\\r\\nMiss P. has, of course, given her a proper understanding of the\\r\\nbusiness. It is evident that Miss F. did not expect or wish to have the\\r\\nvisit returned, and Frank is quite as much on his guard for his wife as\\r\\nwe could desire for her sake or our own.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall rejoice in being so near Winchester when Edward belongs to it,\\r\\nand can never have our spare bed filled more to our satisfaction than by\\r\\nhim. Does he leave Eltham at Easter?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are reading \"Clarentine,\" and are surprised to find how foolish it\\r\\nis. I remember liking it much less on a second reading than at the\\r\\nfirst, and it does not bear a third at all. It is full of unnatural\\r\\nconduct and forced difficulties, without striking merit of any kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Harrison is going into Devonshire, to attend Mrs. Dusantoy, as\\r\\nusual. Miss J. is married to young Mr. G., and is to be very unhappy. He\\r\\nswears, drinks, is cross, jealous, selfish, and brutal. The match makes\\r\\nher family miserable, and has occasioned his being disinherited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Browns are added to our list of acquaintance. He commands the Sea\\r\\nFencibles here, under Sir Thomas, and was introduced at his own desire\\r\\nby the latter when we saw him last week. As yet the gentlemen only have\\r\\nvisited, as Mrs. B. is ill; but she is a nice-looking woman, and wears\\r\\none of the prettiest straw bonnets in the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Monday._--The garret beds are made, and ours will be finished to-day. I\\r\\nhad hoped it would be finished on Saturday, but neither Mrs. Hall nor\\r\\nJenny was able to give help enough for that, and I have as yet done very\\r\\nlittle, and Mary nothing at all. This week we shall do more, and I\\r\\nshould like to have all the five beds completed by the end of it. There\\r\\nwill then be the window-curtains, sofa-cover, and a carpet to be\\r\\naltered.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should not be surprised if we were to be visited by James again this\\r\\nweek; he gave us reason to expect him soon, and if they go to Eversley\\r\\nhe cannot come next week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, I flatter myself I have constructed you a smartish letter,\\r\\nconsidering my want of materials; but, like my dear Dr. Johnson, I\\r\\nbelieve I have dealt more in notions than facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope your cough is gone, and that you are otherwise well, and remain,\\r\\nwith love,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             GODMERSHAM, Wednesday (June 15, 1808).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Where shall I begin? Which of all my important\\r\\nnothings shall I tell you first? At half after seven yesterday morning\\r\\nHenry saw us into our own carriage, and we drove away from the Bath\\r\\nHotel; which, by the by, had been found most uncomfortable\\r\\nquarters,--very dirty, very noisy, and very ill-provided. James began\\r\\nhis journey by the coach at five. Our first eight miles were hot;\\r\\nDeptford Hill brought to my mind our hot journey into Kent fourteen\\r\\nyears ago; but after Blackheath we suffered nothing, and as the day\\r\\nadvanced it grew quite cool. At Dartford, which we reached within the\\r\\ntwo hours and three-quarters, we went to the Bull, the same inn at\\r\\nwhich we breakfasted in that said journey, and on the present occasion\\r\\nhad about the same bad butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling on without any\\r\\nadventure reached Sittingbourne by three. Daniel was watching for us at\\r\\nthe door of the George, and I was acknowledged very kindly by Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Marshall, to the latter of whom I devoted my conversation, while\\r\\nMary went out to buy some gloves. A few minutes, of course, did for\\r\\nSittingbourne; and so off we drove, drove, drove, and by six o\\'clock\\r\\nwere at Godmersham.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur two brothers were walking before the house as we approached, as\\r\\nnatural as life. Fanny and Lizzy met us in the Hall with a great deal of\\r\\npleasant joy; we went for a few minutes into the breakfast-parlor, and\\r\\nthen proceeded to our rooms. Mary has the Hall chamber. I am in the\\r\\nYellow room--very literally--for I am writing in it at this moment. It\\r\\nseems odd to me to have such a great place all to myself, and to be at\\r\\nGodmersham without you is also odd.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who came to me as soon as she\\r\\nhad seen her Aunt James to her room, and stayed while I dressed, was as\\r\\nenergetic as usual in her longings for you. She is grown both in height\\r\\nand size since last year, but not immoderately, looks very well, and\\r\\nseems as to conduct and manner just what she was and what one could wish\\r\\nher to continue.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth,[5] who was dressing when we arrived, came to me for a minute\\r\\nattended by Marianne, Charles, and Louisa, and, you will not doubt, gave\\r\\nme a very affectionate welcome. That I had received such from Edward\\r\\nalso I need not mention; but I do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I\\r\\nnever saw him look in better health, and Fanny says he is perfectly\\r\\nwell. I cannot praise Elizabeth\\'s looks, but they are probably affected\\r\\nby a cold. Her little namesake has gained in beauty in the last three\\r\\nyears, though not all that Marianne has lost. Charles is not quite so\\r\\nlovely as he was. Louisa is much as I expected, and Cassandra I find\\r\\nhandsomer than I expected, though at present disguised by such a violent\\r\\nbreaking-out that she does not come down after dinner. She has charming\\r\\neyes and a nice open countenance, and seems likely to be very lovable.\\r\\nHer size is magnificent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was agreeably surprised to find Louisa Bridges still here. She looks\\r\\nremarkably well (legacies are very wholesome diet), and is just what she\\r\\nalways was. John is at Sandling. You may fancy our dinner-party\\r\\ntherefore; Fanny, of course, belonging to it, and little Edward, for\\r\\nthat day. He was almost too happy, his happiness at least made him too\\r\\ntalkative.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has struck ten; I must go to breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince breakfast I have had a _t\\xc3\\xaate-\\xc3\\xa0-t\\xc3\\xaate_ with Edward in his room; he\\r\\nwanted to know James\\'s plans and mine, and from what his own now are I\\r\\nthink it already nearly certain that I shall return when they do, though\\r\\nnot with them. Edward will be going about the same time to Alton, where\\r\\nhe has business with Mr. Trimmer, and where he means his son should join\\r\\nhim; and I shall probably be his companion to that place, and get on\\r\\nafterwards somehow or other.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have preferred a rather longer stay here certainly, but there\\r\\nis no prospect of any later conveyance for me, as he does not mean to\\r\\naccompany Edward on his return to Winchester, from a very natural\\r\\nunwillingness to leave Elizabeth at that time. I shall at any rate be\\r\\nglad not to be obliged to be an incumbrance on those who have brought me\\r\\nhere, for, as James has no horse, I must feel in their carriage that I\\r\\nam taking his place. We were rather crowded yesterday, though it does\\r\\nnot become me to say so, as I and my boa were of the party, and it is\\r\\nnot to be supposed but that a child of three years of age was fidgety.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need scarcely beg you to keep all this to yourself, lest it should get\\r\\nround by Anna\\'s means. She is very kindly inquired after by her friends\\r\\nhere, who all regret her not coming with her father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left Henry, I hope, free from his tiresome complaint, in other\\r\\nrespects well, and thinking with great pleasure of Cheltenham and\\r\\nStoneleigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brewery scheme is quite at an end: at a meeting of the subscribers\\r\\nlast week it was by general, and I believe very hearty, consent\\r\\ndissolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country is very beautiful. I saw as much as ever to admire in my\\r\\nyesterday\\'s journey. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[5] Mrs. Edward Austen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    CASTLE SQUARE, October 13.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I have received your letter, and with most\\r\\nmelancholy anxiety was it expected, for the sad news[6] reached us last\\r\\nnight, but without any particulars. It came in a short letter to Martha\\r\\nfrom her sister, begun at Steventon and finished in Winchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have felt, we do feel, for you all, as you will not need to be\\r\\ntold,--for you, for Fanny, for Henry, for Lady Bridges, and for dearest\\r\\nEdward, whose loss and whose sufferings seem to make those of every\\r\\nother person nothing. God be praised that you can say what you do of\\r\\nhim: that he has a religious mind to bear him up, and a disposition that\\r\\nwill gradually lead him to comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dear, dear Fanny, I am so thankful that she has you with her! You\\r\\nwill be everything to her; you will give her all the consolation that\\r\\nhuman aid can give. May the Almighty sustain you all, and keep you, my\\r\\ndearest Cassandra, well; but for the present I dare say you are equal to\\r\\neverything.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will know that the poor boys are at Steventon. Perhaps it is best\\r\\nfor them, as they will have more means of exercise and amusement there\\r\\nthan they could have with us, but I own myself disappointed by the\\r\\narrangement. I should have loved to have them with me at such a time. I\\r\\nshall write to Edward by this post.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall, of course, hear from you again very soon, and as often as you\\r\\ncan write. We will write as you desire, and I shall add Bookham.\\r\\nHamstall, I suppose, you write to yourselves, as you do not mention it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a comfort that Mrs. Deedes is saved from present misery and alarm!\\r\\nBut it will fall heavy upon poor Harriot; and as for Lady B., but that\\r\\nher fortitude does seem truly great, I should fear the effect of such a\\r\\nblow, and so unlooked for. I long to hear more of you all. Of Henry\\'s\\r\\nanguish I think with grief and solicitude; but he will exert himself to\\r\\nbe of use and comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith what true sympathy our feelings are shared by Martha you need not\\r\\nbe told; she is the friend and sister under every circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need not enter into a panegyric on the departed, but it is sweet to\\r\\nthink of her great worth, of her solid principles, of her true devotion,\\r\\nher excellence in every relation of life. It is also consolatory to\\r\\nreflect on the shortness of the sufferings which led her from this world\\r\\nto a better.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarewell for the present, my dearest sister. Tell Edward that we feel\\r\\nfor him and pray for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                      J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will write to Catherine.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you can give me some directions about mourning.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[6] The death of Mrs. Edward Austen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                          CASTLE SQUARE, Saturday night (October 15).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your accounts make us as comfortable as we can\\r\\nexpect to be at such a time. Edward\\'s loss is terrible, and must be felt\\r\\nas such, and these are too early days indeed to think of moderation in\\r\\ngrief, either in him or his afflicted daughter, but soon we may hope\\r\\nthat our dear Fanny\\'s sense of duty to that beloved father will rouse\\r\\nher to exertion. For his sake, and as the most acceptable proof of love\\r\\nto the spirit of her departed mother, she will try to be tranquil and\\r\\nresigned. Does she feel you to be a comfort to her, or is she too much\\r\\noverpowered for anything but solitude?\\r\\n\\r\\nYour account of Lizzy is very interesting. Poor child! One must hope the\\r\\nimpression will be strong, and yet one\\'s heart aches for a dejected mind\\r\\nof eight years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose you see the corpse? How does it appear? We are anxious to be\\r\\nassured that Edward will not attend the funeral, but when it comes to\\r\\nthe point I think he must feel it impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour parcel shall set off on Monday, and I hope the shoes will fit;\\r\\nMartha and I both tried them on. I shall send you such of your mourning\\r\\nas I think most likely to be useful, reserving for myself your stockings\\r\\nand half the velvet, in which selfish arrangement I know I am doing what\\r\\nyou wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am to be in bombazeen and crape, according to what we are told is\\r\\nuniversal here, and which agrees with Martha\\'s previous observation. My\\r\\nmourning, however, will not impoverish me, for by having my velvet\\r\\npelisse fresh lined and made up, I am sure I shall have no occasion this\\r\\nwinter for anything new of that sort. I take my cloak for the lining,\\r\\nand shall send yours on the chance of its doing something of the same\\r\\nfor you, though I believe your pelisse is in better repair than mine.\\r\\nOne Miss Baker makes my gown and the other my bonnet, which is to be\\r\\nsilk covered with crape.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have written to Edward Cooper, and hope he will not send one of his\\r\\nletters of cruel comfort to my poor brother: and yesterday I wrote to\\r\\nAlethea Bigg, in reply to a letter from her. She tells us in confidence\\r\\nthat Catherine is to be married on Tuesday se\\'nnight. Mr. Hill is\\r\\nexpected at Manydown in the course of the ensuing week.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are desired by Mrs. Harrison and Miss Austen to say everything proper\\r\\nfor them to yourself and Edward on this sad occasion, especially that\\r\\nnothing but a wish of not giving additional trouble where so much is\\r\\ninevitable prevents their writing themselves to express their concern.\\r\\nThey seem truly to feel concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad you can say what you do of Mrs. Knight and of Goodnestone in\\r\\ngeneral. It is a great relief to me to know that the shock did not make\\r\\nany of them ill. But what a task was yours to announce it! Now I hope\\r\\nyou are not overpowered with letter-writing, as Henry and John can ease\\r\\nyou of many of your correspondents.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas Mr. Scudamore in the house at the time, was any application\\r\\nattempted, and is the seizure at all accounted for?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sunday._--As Edward\\'s letter to his son is not come here, we know that\\r\\nyou must have been informed as early as Friday of the boys being at\\r\\nSteventon, which I am glad of.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon your letter to Dr. Goddard\\'s being forwarded to them, Mary wrote to\\r\\nask whether my mother wished to have her grandsons sent to her. We\\r\\ndecided on their remaining where they were, which I hope my brother will\\r\\napprove of. I am sure he will do us the justice of believing that in\\r\\nsuch a decision we sacrificed inclination to what we thought best.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall write by the coach to-morrow to Mrs. J. A., and to Edward, about\\r\\ntheir mourning, though this day\\'s post will probably bring directions to\\r\\nthem on that subject from yourselves. I shall certainly make use of the\\r\\nopportunity of addressing our nephew on the most serious of all\\r\\nconcerns, as I naturally did in my letter to him before. The poor boys\\r\\nare, perhaps, more comfortable at Steventon than they could be here, but\\r\\nyou will understand my feelings with respect to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-morrow will be a dreadful day for you all. Mr. Whitfield\\'s will be a\\r\\nsevere duty.[7] Glad shall I be to hear that it is over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat you are forever in our thoughts you will not doubt. I see your\\r\\nmournful party in my mind\\'s eye under every varying circumstance of the\\r\\nday; and in the evening especially figure to myself its sad gloom: the\\r\\nefforts to talk, the frequent summons to melancholy orders and cares,\\r\\nand poor Edward, restless in misery, going from one room to another, and\\r\\nperhaps not seldom upstairs, to see all that remains of his Elizabeth.\\r\\nDearest Fanny must now look upon herself as his prime source of comfort,\\r\\nhis dearest friend; as the being who is gradually to supply to him, to\\r\\nthe extent that is possible, what he has lost. This consideration will\\r\\nelevate and cheer her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu. You cannot write too often, as I said before. We are heartily\\r\\nrejoiced that the poor baby gives you no particular anxiety. Kiss dear\\r\\nLizzy for us. Tell Fanny that I shall write in a day or two to Miss\\r\\nSharpe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother is not ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours most truly,      J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell Henry that a hamper of apples is gone to him from Kintbury, and\\r\\nthat Mr. Fowle intended writing on Friday (supposing him in London) to\\r\\nbeg that the charts, etc., may be consigned to the care of the Palmers.\\r\\nMrs. Fowle has also written to Miss Palmer to beg she will send for\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[7] Mr. Whitfield was the Rector of Godmersham at this time, having come\\r\\nthere in 1778.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    CASTLE SQUARE, Monday (October 24).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Edward and George came to us soon after seven on\\r\\nSaturday, very well, but very cold, having by choice travelled on the\\r\\noutside, and with no greatcoat but what Mr. Wise, the coachman,\\r\\ngood-naturedly spared them of his, as they sat by his side. They were so\\r\\nmuch chilled when they arrived, that I was afraid they must have taken\\r\\ncold; but it does not seem at all the case: I never saw them looking\\r\\nbetter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey behave extremely well in every respect, showing quite as much\\r\\nfeeling as one wishes to see, and on every occasion speaking of their\\r\\nfather with the liveliest affection. His letter was read over by each of\\r\\nthem yesterday, and with many tears; George sobbed aloud, Edward\\'s tears\\r\\ndo not flow so easily; but as far as I can judge they are both very\\r\\nproperly impressed by what has happened. Miss Lloyd, who is a more\\r\\nimpartial judge than I can be, is exceedingly pleased with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge is almost a new acquaintance to me, and I find him in a different\\r\\nway as engaging as Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not want amusement: bilbocatch, at which George is indefatigable,\\r\\nspillikins, paper ships, riddles, conundrums, and cards, with watching\\r\\nthe flow and ebb of the river, and now and then a stroll out, keep us\\r\\nwell employed; and we mean to avail ourselves of our kind papa\\'s\\r\\nconsideration, by not returning to Winchester till quite the evening of\\r\\nWednesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. J. A. had not time to get them more than one suit of clothes; their\\r\\nothers are making here, and though I do not believe Southampton is\\r\\nfamous for tailoring, I hope it will prove itself better than\\r\\nBasingstoke. Edward has an old black coat, which will save his having a\\r\\nsecond new one; but I find that black pantaloons are considered by them\\r\\nas necessary, and of course one would not have them made uncomfortable\\r\\nby the want of what is usual on such occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny\\'s letter was received with great pleasure yesterday, and her\\r\\nbrother sends his thanks and will answer it soon. We all saw what she\\r\\nwrote, and were very much pleased with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-morrow I hope to hear from you, and to-morrow we must think of poor\\r\\nCatherine. To-day Lady Bridges is the heroine of our thoughts, and glad\\r\\nshall we be when we can fancy the meeting over. There will then be\\r\\nnothing so very bad for Edward to undergo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"St. Albans,\" I find, sailed on the very day of my letters reaching\\r\\nYarmouth, so that we must not expect an answer at present; we scarcely\\r\\nfeel, however, to be in suspense, or only enough to keep our plans to\\r\\nourselves. We have been obliged to explain them to our young visitors,\\r\\nin consequence of Fanny\\'s letter, but we have not yet mentioned them to\\r\\nSteventon. We are all quite familiarized to the idea ourselves; my\\r\\nmother only wants Mrs. Seward to go out at midsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat sort of a kitchen garden is there? Mrs. J. A. expresses her fear of\\r\\nour settling in Kent, and, till this proposal was made, we began to look\\r\\nforward to it here; my mother was actually talking of a house at Wye. It\\r\\nwill be best, however, as it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne has just given her mistress warning; she is going to be married; I\\r\\nwish she would stay her year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the subject of matrimony, I must notice a wedding in the Salisbury\\r\\npaper, which has amused me very much, Dr. Phillot to Lady Frances St.\\r\\nLawrence. She wanted to have a husband, I suppose, once in her life, and\\r\\nhe a Lady Frances.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope your sorrowing party were at church yesterday, and have no longer\\r\\nthat to dread. Martha was kept at home by a cold, but I went with my two\\r\\nnephews, and I saw Edward was much affected by the sermon, which,\\r\\nindeed, I could have supposed purposely addressed to the afflicted, if\\r\\nthe text had not naturally come in the course of Dr. Mant\\'s observations\\r\\non the Litany: \\'All that are in danger, necessity, or tribulation,\\' was\\r\\nthe subject of it. The weather did not allow us afterwards to get\\r\\nfarther than the quay, where George was very happy as long as we could\\r\\nstay, flying about from one side to the other, and skipping on board a\\r\\ncollier immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening we had the Psalms and Lessons, and a sermon at home, to\\r\\nwhich they were very attentive; but you will not expect to hear that\\r\\nthey did not return to conundrums the moment it was over. Their aunt has\\r\\nwritten pleasantly of them, which was more than I hoped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I write now, George is most industriously making and naming paper\\r\\nships, at which he afterwards shoots with horse-chestnuts, brought from\\r\\nSteventon on purpose; and Edward equally intent over the \"Lake of\\r\\nKillarney,\" twisting himself about in one of our great chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tuesday._--Your close-written letter makes me quite ashamed of my wide\\r\\nlines; you have sent me a great deal of matter, most of it very welcome.\\r\\nAs to your lengthened stay, it is no more than I expected, and what must\\r\\nbe, but you cannot suppose I like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that you say of Edward is truly comfortable; I began to fear that\\r\\nwhen the bustle of the first week was over, his spirits might for a time\\r\\nbe more depressed; and perhaps one must still expect something of the\\r\\nkind. If you escape a bilious attack, I shall wonder almost as much as\\r\\nrejoice. I am glad you mentioned where Catherine goes to-day; it is a\\r\\ngood plan, but sensible people may generally be trusted to form such.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day began cheerfully, but it is not likely to continue what it\\r\\nshould, for them or for us. We had a little water-party yesterday; I and\\r\\nmy two nephews went from the Itchen Ferry up to Northam, where we\\r\\nlanded, looked into the 74, and walked home, and it was so much enjoyed\\r\\nthat I had intended to take them to Netley to-day; the tide is just\\r\\nright for our going immediately after moonshine, but I am afraid there\\r\\nwill be rain; if we cannot get so far, however, we may perhaps go round\\r\\nfrom the ferry to the quay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not proposed doing more than cross the Itchen yesterday, but it\\r\\nproved so pleasant, and so much to the satisfaction of all, that when we\\r\\nreached the middle of the stream we agreed to be rowed up the river;\\r\\nboth the boys rowed great part of the way, and their questions and\\r\\nremarks, as well as their enjoyment, were very amusing; George\\'s\\r\\ninquiries were endless, and his eagerness in everything reminds me often\\r\\nof his uncle Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur evening was equally agreeable in its way: I introduced speculation,\\r\\nand it was so much approved that we hardly knew how to leave off.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour idea of an early dinner to-morrow is exactly what we propose, for,\\r\\nafter writing the first part of this letter, it came into my head that\\r\\nat this time of year we have not summer evenings. We shall watch the\\r\\nlight to-day, that we may not give them a dark drive to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey send their best love to papa and everybody, with George\\'s thanks\\r\\nfor the letter brought by this post. Martha begs my brother may be\\r\\nassured of her interest in everything relating to him and his family,\\r\\nand of her sincerely partaking our pleasure in the receipt of every good\\r\\naccount from Godmersham.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Chawton I think I can have nothing more to say, but that everything\\r\\nyou say about it in the letter now before me will, I am sure, as soon as\\r\\nI am able to read it to her, make my mother consider the plan with more\\r\\nand more pleasure. We had formed the same views on H. Digweed\\'s farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very kind and feeling letter is arrived to-day from Kintbury. Mrs.\\r\\nFowle\\'s sympathy and solicitude on such an occasion you will be able to\\r\\ndo justice to, and to express it as she wishes to my brother. Concerning\\r\\nyou, she says: \"Cassandra will, I know, excuse my writing to her; it is\\r\\nnot to save myself but her that I omit so doing. Give my best, my\\r\\nkindest love to her, and tell her I feel for her as I know she would for\\r\\nme on the same occasion, and that I most sincerely hope her health will\\r\\nnot suffer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have just had two hampers of apples from Kintbury, and the floor of\\r\\nour little garret is almost covered. Love to all.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                Yours very affectionately,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    CASTLE SQUARE, Sunday (November 21).\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUR letter, my dear Cassandra, obliges me to write immediately, that\\r\\nyou may have the earliest notice of Frank\\'s intending, if possible, to\\r\\ngo to Godmersham exactly at the time now fixed for your visit to\\r\\nGoodnestone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe resolved, almost directly on the receipt of your former letter, to\\r\\ntry for an extension of his leave of absence, that he might be able to\\r\\ngo down to you for two days, but charged me not to give you any notice\\r\\nof it, on account of the uncertainty of success. Now, however, I must\\r\\ngive it, and now perhaps he may be giving it himself; for I am just in\\r\\nthe hateful predicament of being obliged to write what I know will\\r\\nsomehow or other be of no use.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe meant to ask for five days more, and if they were granted, to go down\\r\\nby Thursday night\\'s mail, and spend Friday and Saturday with you; and he\\r\\nconsidered his chance of succeeding by no means bad. I hope it will take\\r\\nplace as he planned, and that your arrangements with Goodnestone may\\r\\nadmit of suitable alteration.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour news of Edward Bridges was quite news, for I have had no letter\\r\\nfrom Wrotham. I wish him happy with all my heart, and hope his choice\\r\\nmay turn out according to his own expectations, and beyond those of his\\r\\nfamily; and I dare say it will. Marriage is a great improver, and in a\\r\\nsimilar situation Harriet may be as amiable as Eleanor. As to money,\\r\\nthat will come, you may be sure, because they cannot do without it. When\\r\\nyou see him again, pray give him our congratulations and best wishes.\\r\\nThis match will certainly set John and Lucy going.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are six bedchambers at Chawton; Henry wrote to my mother the other\\r\\nday, and luckily mentioned the number, which is just what we wanted to\\r\\nbe assured of. He speaks also of garrets for store-places, one of which\\r\\nshe immediately planned fitting up for Edward\\'s man-servant; and now\\r\\nperhaps it must be for our own; for she is already quite reconciled to\\r\\nour keeping one. The difficulty of doing without one had been thought of\\r\\nbefore. His name shall be Robert, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I can tell you of it, you will have heard that Miss Sawbridge is\\r\\nmarried. It took place, I believe, on Thursday. Mrs. Fowle has for some\\r\\ntime been in the secret, but the neighborhood in general were quite\\r\\nunsuspicious. Mr. Maxwell was tutor to the young Gregorys,--consequently,\\r\\nthey must be one of the happiest couples in the world, and either of\\r\\nthem worthy of envy, for she must be excessively in love, and he mounts\\r\\nfrom nothing to a comfortable home. Martha has heard him very highly\\r\\nspoken of. They continue for the present at Speen Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a Southampton match to return for your Kentish one, Captain G.\\r\\nHeathcote and Miss A. Lyell. I have it from Alethea, and like it,\\r\\nbecause I had made it before.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the Stoneleigh business is concluded, but it was not till yesterday\\r\\nthat my mother was regularly informed of it, though the news had reached\\r\\nus on Monday evening by way of Steventon. My aunt says as little as may\\r\\nbe on the subject by way of information, and nothing at all by way of\\r\\nsatisfaction. She reflects on Mr. T. Leigh\\'s dilatoriness, and looks\\r\\nabout with great diligence and success for inconvenience and evil, among\\r\\nwhich she ingeniously places the danger of her new housemaids catching\\r\\ncold on the outside of the coach, when she goes down to Bath, for a\\r\\ncarriage makes her sick.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Binns has been offered their place, but declines it; as she\\r\\nsupposes, because he will not wear a livery. Whatever be the cause, I\\r\\nlike the effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of all my mother\\'s long and intimate knowledge of the writer,\\r\\nshe was not up to the expectation of such a letter as this; the\\r\\ndiscontentedness of it shocked and surprised her--but I see nothing in\\r\\nit out of nature, though a sad nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe does not forget to wish for Chambers, you may be sure. No\\r\\nparticulars are given, not a word of arrears mentioned, though in her\\r\\nletter to James they were in a general way spoken of. The amount of them\\r\\nis a matter of conjecture, and to my mother a most interesting one; she\\r\\ncannot fix any time for their beginning with any satisfaction to herself\\r\\nbut Mrs. Leigh\\'s death, and Henry\\'s two thousand pounds neither agrees\\r\\nwith that period nor any other. I did not like to own our previous\\r\\ninformation of what was intended last July, and have therefore only said\\r\\nthat if we could see Henry we might hear many particulars, as I had\\r\\nunderstood that some confidential conversation had passed between him\\r\\nand Mr. T. L. at Stoneleigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been as quiet as usual since Frank and Mary left us; Mr.\\r\\nCriswick called on Martha that very morning on his way home again from\\r\\nPortsmouth, and we have had no visitor since.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe called on the Miss Lyells one day, and heard a good account of Mr.\\r\\nHeathcote\\'s canvass, the success of which, of course, exceeds his\\r\\nexpectations. Alethea in her letter hopes for my interest, which I\\r\\nconclude means Edward\\'s, and I take this opportunity, therefore, of\\r\\nrequesting that he will bring in Mr. Heathcote. Mr. Lane told us\\r\\nyesterday that Mr. H. had behaved very handsomely, and waited on Mr.\\r\\nThistlethwaite, to say that if he (Mr. T.) would stand, he (Mr. H.)\\r\\nwould not oppose him; but Mr. T. declined it, acknowledging himself\\r\\nstill smarting under the payment of late electioneering costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mrs. Hulberts, we learn from Kintbury, come to Steventon this week,\\r\\nand bring Mary Jane Fowle with them on her way to Mrs. Nune\\'s; she\\r\\nreturns at Christmas with her brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur brother we may perhaps see in the course of a few days, and we mean\\r\\nto take the opportunity of his help to go one night to the play. Martha\\r\\nought to see the inside of the theatre once while she lives in\\r\\nSouthampton, and I think she will hardly wish to take a second view.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe furniture of Bellevue is to be sold to-morrow, and we shall take it\\r\\nin our usual walk, if the weather be favorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow could you have a wet day on Thursday? With us it was a prince of\\r\\ndays, the most delightful we have had for weeks; soft, bright, with a\\r\\nbrisk wind from the southwest; everybody was out and talking of spring,\\r\\nand Martha and I did not know how to turn back. On Friday evening we had\\r\\nsome very blowing weather,--from six to nine; I think we never heard it\\r\\nworse, even here. And one night we had so much rain that it forced its\\r\\nway again into the store-closet; and though the evil was comparatively\\r\\nslight and the mischief nothing, I had some employment the next day in\\r\\ndrying parcels, etc. I have now moved still more out of the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha sends her best love, and thanks you for admitting her to the\\r\\nknowledge of the pros and cons about Harriet Foote; she has an interest\\r\\nin all such matters. I am also to say that she wants to see you. Mary\\r\\nJane missed her papa and mamma a good deal at first, but now does very\\r\\nwell without them. I am glad to hear of little John\\'s being better, and\\r\\nhope your accounts of Mrs. Knight will also improve. Adieu! remember me\\r\\naffectionately to everybody, and believe me,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                 Ever yours,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    CASTLE SQUARE, Friday (December 9).\\r\\n\\r\\nMANY thanks, my dear Cassandra, to you and Mr. Deedes for your joint and\\r\\nagreeable composition, which took me by surprise this morning. He has\\r\\ncertainly great merit as a writer; he does ample justice to his subject,\\r\\nand without being diffuse is clear and correct; and though I do not\\r\\nmean to compare his epistolary powers with yours, or to give him the\\r\\nsame portion of my gratitude, he certainly has a very pleasing way of\\r\\nwinding up a whole, and speeding truth into the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But all this,\" as my dear Mrs. Piozzi says, \"is flight and fancy and\\r\\nnonsense, for my master has his great casks to mind and I have my little\\r\\nchildren.\" It is you, however, in this instance, that have the little\\r\\nchildren, and I that have the great cask, for we are brewing spruce beer\\r\\nagain; but my meaning really is, that I am extremely foolish in writing\\r\\nall this unnecessary stuff when I have so many matters to write about\\r\\nthat my paper will hardly hold it all. Little matters they are, to be\\r\\nsure, but highly important.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, Miss Curling is actually at Portsmouth, which I was\\r\\nalways in hopes would not happen. I wish her no worse, however, than a\\r\\nlong and happy abode there. Here she would probably be dull, and I am\\r\\nsure she would be troublesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bracelets are in my possession, and everything I could wish them to\\r\\nbe. They came with Martha\\'s pelisse, which likewise gives great\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after I had closed my last letter to you we were visited by Mrs.\\r\\nDickens and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bertie, the wife of a lately made\\r\\nAdmiral. Mrs. F. A.,[8] I believe, was their first object, but they put\\r\\nup with us very kindly, and Mrs. D., finding in Miss Lloyd a friend of\\r\\nMrs. Dundas, had another motive for the acquaintance. She seems a really\\r\\nagreeable woman,--that is, her manners are gentle, and she knows a great\\r\\nmany of our connections in West Kent. Mrs. Bertie lives in the Polygon,\\r\\nand was out when we returned her visit, which are her two virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nA larger circle of acquaintance, and an increase of amusement, is quite\\r\\nin character with our approaching removal. Yes, I mean to go to as many\\r\\nballs as possible, that I may have a good bargain. Everybody is very\\r\\nmuch concerned at our going away, and everybody is acquainted with\\r\\nChawton, and speaks of it as a remarkably pretty village, and everybody\\r\\nknows the house we describe, but nobody fixes on the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very much obliged to Mrs. Knight for such a proof of the interest\\r\\nshe takes in me, and she may depend upon it that I will marry Mr.\\r\\nPapillon, whatever may be his reluctance or my own. I owe her much more\\r\\nthan such a trifling sacrifice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ball was rather more amusing than I expected. Martha liked it very\\r\\nmuch, and I did not gape till the last quarter of an hour. It was past\\r\\nnine before we were sent for, and not twelve when we returned. The room\\r\\nwas tolerably full, and there were, perhaps, thirty couple of dancers.\\r\\nThe melancholy part was to see so many dozen young women standing by\\r\\nwithout partners, and each of them with two ugly naked shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the same room in which we danced fifteen years ago. I thought it\\r\\nall over, and in spite of the shame of being so much older, felt with\\r\\nthankfulness that I was quite as happy now as then. We paid an\\r\\nadditional shilling for our tea, which we took as we chose in an\\r\\nadjoining and very comfortable room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were only four dances, and it went to my heart that the Miss\\r\\nLances (one of them, too, named Emma) should have partners only for two.\\r\\nYou will not expect to hear that I was asked to dance, but I was--by the\\r\\ngentleman whom we met that Sunday with Captain D\\'Auvergne. We have\\r\\nalways kept up a bowing acquaintance since, and, being pleased with his\\r\\nblack eyes, I spoke to him at the ball, which brought on me this\\r\\ncivility; but I do not know his name, and he seems so little at home in\\r\\nthe English language that I believe his black eyes may be the best of\\r\\nhim. Captain D\\'Auvergne has got a ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha and I made use of the very favorable state of yesterday for\\r\\nwalking, to pay our duty at Chiswell. We found Mrs. Lance at home and\\r\\nalone, and sat out three other ladies who soon came in. We went by the\\r\\nferry, and returned by the bridge, and were scarcely at all fatigued.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward must have enjoyed the last two days. You, I presume, had a cool\\r\\ndrive to Canterbury. Kitty Foote came on Wednesday; and her evening\\r\\nvisit began early enough for the last part, the apple-pie, of our\\r\\ndinner, for we never dine now till five.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday I--or rather, you--had a letter from Nanny Hilliard, the\\r\\nobject of which is that she would be very much obliged to us if we would\\r\\nget Hannah a place. I am sorry that I cannot assist her; if you can, let\\r\\nme know, as I shall not answer the letter immediately. Mr. Sloper is\\r\\nmarried again, not much to Nanny\\'s, or anybody\\'s satisfaction. The lady\\r\\nwas governess to Sir Robert\\'s natural children, and seems to have\\r\\nnothing to recommend her. I do not find, however, that Nanny is likely\\r\\nto lose her place in consequence. She says not a word of what service\\r\\nshe wishes for Hannah, or what Hannah can do; but a nursery, I suppose,\\r\\nor something of that kind, must be the thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now cleared away my smaller articles of news, I come to a\\r\\ncommunication of some weight; no less than that my uncle and aunt[9] are\\r\\ngoing to allow James 100_l._ a year. We hear of it through Steventon.\\r\\nMary sent us the other day an extract from my aunt\\'s letter on the\\r\\nsubject, in which the donation is made with the greatest kindness, and\\r\\nintended as a compensation for his loss in the conscientious refusal of\\r\\nHampstead living; 100_l._ a year being all that he had at the time\\r\\ncalled its worth, as I find it was always intended at Steventon to\\r\\ndivide the real income with Kintbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing can be more affectionate than my aunt\\'s language in making the\\r\\npresent, and likewise in expressing her hope of their being much more\\r\\ntogether in future than, to her great regret, they have of late years\\r\\nbeen. My expectations for my mother do not rise with this event. We will\\r\\nallow a little more time, however, before we fly out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf not prevented by parish business, James comes to us on Monday. The\\r\\nMrs. Hulberts and Miss Murden are their guests at present, and likely to\\r\\ncontinue such till Christmas. Anna comes home on the 19th. The hundred a\\r\\nyear begins next Lady-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad you are to have Henry with you again; with him and the boys\\r\\nyou cannot but have a cheerful, and at times even a merry, Christmas.\\r\\nMartha is so [_MSS. torn_]. . . . We want to be settled at Chawton in time\\r\\nfor Henry to come to us for some shooting in October, at least, or a\\r\\nlittle earlier, and Edward may visit us after taking his boys back to\\r\\nWinchester. Suppose we name the 4th of September. Will not that do?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have but one thing more to tell you. Mrs. Hill called on my mother\\r\\nyesterday while we were gone to Chiswell, and in the course of the\\r\\nvisit asked her whether she knew anything of a clergyman\\'s family of the\\r\\nname of Alford, who had resided in our part of Hampshire. Mrs. Hill had\\r\\nbeen applied to as likely to give some information of them on account of\\r\\ntheir probable vicinity to Dr. Hill\\'s living by a lady, or for a lady,\\r\\nwho had known Mrs. and the two Miss Alfords in Bath, whither they had\\r\\nremoved it seems from Hampshire, and who now wishes to convey to the\\r\\nMiss Alfords some work or trimming which she has been doing for them;\\r\\nbut the mother and daughters have left Bath, and the lady cannot learn\\r\\nwhere they are gone to. While my mother gave us the account, the\\r\\nprobability of its being ourselves occurred to us, and it had previously\\r\\nstruck herself . . . what makes it more likely, and even indispensably\\r\\nto be us, is that she mentioned Mr. Hammond as now having the living or\\r\\ncuracy which the father had had. I cannot think who our kind lady can\\r\\nbe, but I dare say we shall not like the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nDistribute the affectionate love of a heart not so tired as the right\\r\\nhand belonging to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Yours ever sincerely,          J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[8] Frank Austen.\\r\\n\\r\\n[9] Mr. and Mrs. Leigh Perrot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (December 27).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I can now write at leisure and make the most of my\\r\\nsubjects, which is lucky, as they are not numerous this week.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur house was cleared by half-past eleven on Saturday, and we had the\\r\\nsatisfaction of hearing yesterday that the party reached home in safety\\r\\nsoon after five.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very glad of your letter this morning; for, my mother taking\\r\\nmedicine, Eliza keeping her bed with a cold, and Choles not coming, made\\r\\nus rather dull and dependent on the post. You tell me much that gives me\\r\\npleasure, but I think not much to answer. I wish I could help you in\\r\\nyour needlework. I have two hands and a new thimble that lead a very\\r\\neasy life.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Sondes\\' match surprises, but does not offend me; had her first\\r\\nmarriage been of affection, or had there been a grown-up single\\r\\ndaughter, I should not have forgiven her; but I consider everybody as\\r\\nhaving a right to marry once in their lives for love, if they can, and\\r\\nprovided she will now leave off having bad headaches and being pathetic,\\r\\nI can allow her, I can wish her, to be happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not imagine that your picture of your _t\\xc3\\xaate-\\xc3\\xa0-t\\xc3\\xaate_ with Sir B. makes\\r\\nany change in our expectations here; he could not be really reading,\\r\\nthough he held the newspaper in his hand; he was making up his mind to\\r\\nthe deed, and the manner of it. I think you will have a letter from him\\r\\nsoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard from Portsmouth yesterday, and as I am to send them more\\r\\nclothes, they cannot be expecting a very early return to us. Mary\\'s face\\r\\nis pretty well, but she must have suffered a great deal with it; an\\r\\nabscess was formed and opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur evening party on Thursday produced nothing more remarkable than Miss\\r\\nMurden\\'s coming too, though she had declined it absolutely in the\\r\\nmorning, and sitting very ungracious and very silent with us from seven\\r\\no\\'clock till half after eleven, for so late was it, owing to the\\r\\nchairmen, before we got rid of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last hour, spent in yawning and shivering in a wide circle round the\\r\\nfire, was dull enough, but the tray had admirable success. The widgeon\\r\\nand the preserved ginger were as delicious as one could wish. But as to\\r\\nour black butter, do not decoy anybody to Southampton by such a lure,\\r\\nfor it is all gone. The first pot was opened when Frank and Mary were\\r\\nhere, and proved not at all what it ought to be; it was neither solid\\r\\nnor entirely sweet, and on seeing it, Eliza remembered that Miss Austen\\r\\nhad said she did not think it had been boiled enough. It was made, you\\r\\nknow, when we were absent. Such being the event of the first pot, I\\r\\nwould not save the second, and we therefore ate it in unpretending\\r\\nprivacy; and though not what it ought to be, part of it was very good.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames means to keep three horses on this increase of income; at present\\r\\nhe has but one. Mary wishes the other two to be fit to carry women, and\\r\\nin the purchase of one Edward will probably be called upon to fulfil his\\r\\npromise to his godson. We have now pretty well ascertained James\\'s\\r\\nincome to be eleven hundred pounds, curate paid, which makes us very\\r\\nhappy,--the ascertainment as well as the income.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary does not talk of the garden; it may well be a disagreeable subject\\r\\nto her, but her husband is persuaded that nothing is wanting to make the\\r\\nfirst new one good but trenching, which is to be done by his own\\r\\nservants and John Bond, by degrees, not at the expense which trenching\\r\\nthe other amounted to.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was happy to hear, chiefly for Anna\\'s sake, that a ball at Manydown\\r\\nwas once more in agitation; it is called a child\\'s ball, and given by\\r\\nMrs. Heathcote to Wm. Such was its beginning at least, but it will\\r\\nprobably swell into something more. Edward was invited during his stay\\r\\nat Manydown, and it is to take place between this and Twelfth-day. Mrs.\\r\\nHulbert has taken Anna a pair of white shoes on the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI forgot in my last to tell you that we hear, by way of Kintbury and the\\r\\nPalmers, that they were all well at Bermuda in the beginning of Nov.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday._--Yesterday must have been a day of sad remembrance at\\r\\nGm.[10] I am glad it is over. We spent Friday evening with our friends at\\r\\nthe boarding-house, and our curiosity was gratified by the sight of\\r\\ntheir fellow-inmates, Mrs. Drew and Miss Hook, Mr. Wynne and Mr.\\r\\nFitzhugh; the latter is brother to Mrs. Lance, and very much the\\r\\ngentleman. He has lived in that house more than twenty years, and, poor\\r\\nman! is so totally deaf that they say he could not hear a cannon, were\\r\\nit fired close to him; having no cannon at hand to make the experiment,\\r\\nI took it for granted, and talked to him a little with my fingers, which\\r\\nwas funny enough. I recommended him to read \"Corinna.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hook is a well-behaved, genteelish woman; Mrs. Drew well behaved,\\r\\nwithout being at all genteel. Mr. Wynne seems a chatty and rather\\r\\nfamiliar young man. Miss Murden was quite a different creature this last\\r\\nevening from what she had been before, owing to her having with Martha\\'s\\r\\nhelp found a situation in the morning, which bids very fair for comfort.\\r\\nWhen she leaves Steventon, she comes to board and lodge with Mrs.\\r\\nHookey, the chemist--for there is no Mr. Hookey. I cannot say that I am\\r\\nin any hurry for the conclusion of her present visit, but I was truly\\r\\nglad to see her comfortable in mind and spirits; at her age, perhaps,\\r\\none may be as friendless oneself, and in similar circumstances quite as\\r\\ncaptious.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother has been lately adding to her possessions in plate,--a whole\\r\\ntablespoon and a whole dessert-spoon, and six whole teaspoons,--which\\r\\nmakes our sideboard border on the magnificent. They were mostly the\\r\\nproduce of old or useless silver. I have turned the 11_s._ in the list\\r\\ninto 12_s._, and the card looks all the better; a silver tea-ladle is\\r\\nalso added, which will at least answer the purpose of making us\\r\\nsometimes think of John Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have laid Lady Sondes\\' case before Martha, who does not make the least\\r\\nobjection to it, and is particularly pleased with the name of Montresor.\\r\\nI do not agree with her there, but I like his rank very much, and always\\r\\naffix the ideas of strong sense and highly elegant manners to a general.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must write to Charles next week. You may guess in what extravagant\\r\\nterms of praise Earle Harwood speaks of him. He is looked up to by\\r\\neverybody in all America.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall not tell you anything more of Wm. Digweed\\'s china, as your\\r\\nsilence on the subject makes you unworthy of it. Mrs. H. Digweed looks\\r\\nforward with great satisfaction to our being her neighbors. I would\\r\\nhave her enjoy the idea to the utmost, as I suspect there will not be\\r\\nmuch in the reality. With equal pleasure we anticipate an intimacy with\\r\\nher husband\\'s bailiff and his wife, who live close by us, and are said\\r\\nto be remarkably good sort of people.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, yes, we will have a pianoforte, as good a one as can be got for\\r\\nthirty guineas, and I will practise country dances, that we may have\\r\\nsome amusement for our nephews and nieces, when we have the pleasure of\\r\\ntheir company.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha sends her love to Henry, and tells him that he will soon have a\\r\\nbill of Miss Chaplin\\'s, about 14_l._, to pay on her account; but the\\r\\nbill shall not be sent in till his return to town. I hope he comes to\\r\\nyou in good health, and in spirits as good as a first return to\\r\\nGodmersham can allow. With his nephews he will force himself to be\\r\\ncheerful, till he really is so. Send me some intelligence of Eliza; it\\r\\nis a long while since I have heard of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have had snow on the ground here almost a week; it is now going, but\\r\\nSouthampton must boast no longer. We all send our love to Edward junior\\r\\nand his brothers, and I hope Speculation is generally liked.\\r\\n\\r\\nFare you well.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                        J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother has not been out of doors this week, but she keeps pretty\\r\\nwell. We have received through Bookham an indifferent account of your\\r\\ngodmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[10] Godmersham, Edward Austen\\'s place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                            CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 10, 1809).\\r\\n\\r\\nI AM not surprised, my dear Cassandra, that you did not find my last\\r\\nletter very full of matter, and I wish this may not have the same\\r\\ndeficiency; but we are doing nothing ourselves to write about, and I am\\r\\ntherefore quite dependent upon the communications of our friends, or my\\r\\nown wits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis post brought me two interesting letters, yours and one from\\r\\nBookham, in answer to an inquiry of mine about your good godmother, of\\r\\nwhom we had lately received a very alarming account from Paragon. Miss\\r\\nArnold was the informant then, and she spoke of Mrs. E. L. having been\\r\\nvery dangerously ill, and attended by a physician from Oxford.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour letter to Adlestrop may perhaps bring you information from the\\r\\nspot, but in case it should not, I must tell you that she is better;\\r\\nthough Dr. Bourne cannot yet call her out of danger; such was the case\\r\\nlast Wednesday, and Mrs. Cooke\\'s having had no later account is a\\r\\nfavorable sign. I am to hear again from the latter next week, but not\\r\\nthis, if everything goes on well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer disorder is an inflammation on the lungs, arising from a severe\\r\\nchill taken in church last Sunday three weeks; her mind all pious\\r\\ncomposure, as may be supposed. George Cooke was there when her illness\\r\\nbegan; his brother has now taken his place. Her age and feebleness\\r\\nconsidered, one\\'s fears cannot but preponderate, though her amendment\\r\\nhas already surpassed the expectation of the physician at the beginning.\\r\\nI am sorry to add that Becky is laid up with a complaint of the same\\r\\nkind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very glad to have the time of your return at all fixed; we all\\r\\nrejoice in it, and it will not be later than I had expected. I dare not\\r\\nhope that Mary and Miss Curling may be detained at Portsmouth so long or\\r\\nhalf so long; but it would be worth twopence to have it so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"St. Albans\" perhaps may soon be off to help bring home what may\\r\\nremain by this time of our poor army, whose state seems dreadfully\\r\\ncritical. The \"Regency\" seems to have been heard of only here; my most\\r\\npolitical correspondents make no mention of it. Unlucky that I should\\r\\nhave wasted so much reflection on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can now answer your question to my mother more at large, and likewise\\r\\nmore at small--with equal perspicuity and minuteness; for the very day\\r\\nof our leaving Southampton is fixed; and if the knowledge is of no use\\r\\nto Edward, I am sure it will give him pleasure. Easter Monday, April 3,\\r\\nis the day; we are to sleep that night at Alton, and be with our friends\\r\\nat Bookham the next, if they are then at home; there we remain till the\\r\\nfollowing Monday, and on Tuesday, April 11, hope to be at Godmersham. If\\r\\nthe Cookes are absent, we shall finish our journey on the 5th. These\\r\\nplans depend of course upon the weather, but I hope there will be no\\r\\nsettled cold to delay us materially.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make you amends for being at Bookham, it is in contemplation to spend\\r\\na few days at Baiton Lodge in our way out of Kent. The hint of such a\\r\\nvisit is most affectionately welcomed by Mrs. Birch, in one of her odd\\r\\npleasant letters lately, in which she speaks of us with the usual\\r\\ndistinguished kindness, declaring that she shall not be at all satisfied\\r\\nunless a very handsome present is made us immediately from one quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny\\'s not coming with you is no more than we expected; and as we have\\r\\nnot the hope of a bed for her, and shall see her so soon afterwards at\\r\\nGodmersham, we cannot wish it otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam will be quite recovered, I trust, by the time you receive this.\\r\\nWhat a comfort his cross-stitch must have been! Pray tell him that I\\r\\nshould like to see his work very much. I hope our answers this morning\\r\\nhave given satisfaction; we had great pleasure in Uncle Deedes\\' packet;\\r\\nand pray let Marianne know, in private, that I think she is quite right\\r\\nto work a rug for Uncle John\\'s coffee urn, and that I am sure it must\\r\\ngive great pleasure to herself now, and to him when he receives it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preference of Brag over Speculation does not greatly surprise me, I\\r\\nbelieve, because I feel the same myself; but it mortifies me deeply,\\r\\nbecause Speculation was under my patronage; and, after all, what is\\r\\nthere so delightful in a pair royal of Braggers? It is but three nines\\r\\nor three knaves, or a mixture of them. When one comes to reason upon it,\\r\\nit cannot stand its ground against Speculation,--of which I hope Edward\\r\\nis now convinced. Give my love to him if he is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter from Paragon before mentioned was much like those which had\\r\\npreceded it, as to the felicity of its writer. They found their house so\\r\\ndirty and so damp that they were obliged to be a week at an inn. John\\r\\nBinns had behaved most unhandsomely, and engaged himself elsewhere. They\\r\\nhave a man, however, on the same footing, which my aunt does not like,\\r\\nand she finds both him and the new maid-servant very, very inferior to\\r\\nRobert and Martha. Whether they mean to have any other domestics does\\r\\nnot appear, nor whether they are to have a carriage while they are in\\r\\nBath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Holders are as usual, though I believe it is not very usual for them\\r\\nto be happy, which they now are at a great rate, in Hooper\\'s marriage.\\r\\nThe Irvines are not mentioned. The American lady improved as we went on;\\r\\nbut still the same faults in part recurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now in Margiana, and like it very well indeed. We are just going\\r\\nto set off for Northumberland to be shut up in Widdrington Tower, where\\r\\nthere must be two or three sets of victims already immured under a very\\r\\nfine villain.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday._--Your report of Eliza\\'s health gives me great pleasure, and\\r\\nthe progress of the bank is a constant source of satisfaction. With such\\r\\nincreasing profits, tell Henry that I hope he will not work poor\\r\\nHigh-Diddle so hard as he used to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nHas your newspaper given a sad story of a Mrs. Middleton, wife of a\\r\\nfarmer in Yorkshire, her sister, and servant, being almost frozen to\\r\\ndeath in the late weather, her little child quite so? I hope the sister\\r\\nis not our friend Miss Woodd, and I rather think her brother-in-law had\\r\\nmoved into Lincolnshire, but their name and station accord too well.\\r\\nMrs. M. and the maid are said to be tolerably recovered, but the sister\\r\\nis likely to lose the use of her limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles\\'s rug will be finished to-day, and sent to-morrow to Frank, to\\r\\nbe consigned by him to Mr. Turner\\'s care; and I am going to send Marmion\\r\\nout with it,--very generous in me, I think.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have no letter from Adlestrop, we may suppose the good woman was\\r\\nalive on Monday, but I cannot help expecting bad news from thence or\\r\\nBookham in a few days. Do you continue quite well?\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you nothing to say of your little namesake? We join in love and\\r\\nmany happy returns.\\r\\n\\r\\n                               Yours affectionately,       J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manydown ball was a smaller thing than I expected, but it seems to\\r\\nhave made Anna very happy. At her age it would not have done for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                 CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 17).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I am happy to say that we had no second letter from\\r\\nBookham last week. Yours has brought its usual measure of satisfaction\\r\\nand amusement, and I beg your acceptance of all the thanks due on the\\r\\noccasion. Your offer of cravats is very kind, and happens to be\\r\\nparticularly adapted to my wants, but it was an odd thing to occur to\\r\\nyou.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we have got another fall of snow, and are very dreadful; everything\\r\\nseems to turn to snow this winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you have had no more illness among you, and that William will be\\r\\nsoon as well as ever. His working a footstool for Chawton is a most\\r\\nagreeable surprise to me, and I am sure his grandmamma will value it\\r\\nvery much as a proof of his affection and industry, but we shall never\\r\\nhave the heart to put our feet upon it. I believe I must work a muslin\\r\\ncover in satin stitch to keep it from the dirt. I long to know what his\\r\\ncolors are. I guess greens and purples.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward and Henry have started a difficulty respecting our journey,\\r\\nwhich, I must own with some confusion, had never been thought of by us;\\r\\nbut if the former expected by it to prevent our travelling into Kent\\r\\nentirely, he will be disappointed, for we have already determined to go\\r\\nthe Croydon road on leaving Bookham and sleep at Dartford. Will not that\\r\\ndo? There certainly does seem no convenient resting-place on the other\\r\\nroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna went to Clanville last Friday, and I have hopes of her new aunt\\'s\\r\\nbeing really worth her knowing. Perhaps you may never have heard that\\r\\nJames and Mary paid a morning visit there in form some weeks ago, and\\r\\nMary, though by no means disposed to like her, was very much pleased\\r\\nwith her indeed. Her praise, to be sure, proves nothing more than Mrs.\\r\\nM.\\'s being civil and attentive to them, but her being so is in favor of\\r\\nher having good sense. Mary writes of Anna as improved in person, but\\r\\ngives her no other commendation. I am afraid her absence now may deprive\\r\\nher of one pleasure, for that silly Mr. Hammond is actually to give his\\r\\nball on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had some reason to expect a visit from Earle Harwood and James this\\r\\nweek, but they do not come. Miss Murden arrived last night at Mrs.\\r\\nHookey\\'s, as a message and a basket announced to us. You will therefore\\r\\nreturn to an enlarged and, of course, improved society here, especially\\r\\nas the Miss Williamses are come back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were agreeably surprised the other day by a visit from your beauty\\r\\nand mine, each in a new cloth mantle and bonnet; and I dare say you will\\r\\nvalue yourself much on the modest propriety of Miss W.\\'s taste, hers\\r\\nbeing purple and Miss Grace\\'s scarlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can easily suppose that your six weeks here will be fully occupied,\\r\\nwere it only in lengthening the waists of your gowns. I have pretty well\\r\\narranged my spring and summer plans of that kind, and mean to wear out\\r\\nmy spotted muslin before I go. You will exclaim at this, but mine really\\r\\nhas signs of feebleness, which with a little care may come to\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha and Dr. Mant are as bad as ever; he runs after her in the street\\r\\nto apologize for having spoken to a gentleman while she was near him the\\r\\nday before. Poor Mrs. Mant can stand it no longer; she is retired to one\\r\\nof her married daughters\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen William returns to Winchester Mary Jane is to go to Mrs. Nune\\'s for\\r\\na month, and then to Steventon for a fortnight, and it seems likely that\\r\\nshe and her aunt Martha may travel into Berkshire together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall not have a month of Martha after your return, and that month\\r\\nwill be a very interrupted and broken one, but we shall enjoy ourselves\\r\\nthe more when we can get a quiet half-hour together.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo set against your new novel, of which nobody ever heard before, and\\r\\nperhaps never may again, we have got \"Ida of Athens,\" by Miss Owenson,\\r\\nwhich must be very clever, because it was written, as the authoress\\r\\nsays, in three months. We have only read the preface yet, but her Irish\\r\\ngirl does not make me expect much. If the warmth of her language could\\r\\naffect the body, it might be worth reading in this weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu! I must leave off to stir the fire and call on Miss Murden.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Evening._--I have done them both, the first very often. We found our\\r\\nfriend as comfortable as she can ever allow herself to be in cold\\r\\nweather. There is a very neat parlor behind the shop for her to sit in,\\r\\nnot very light indeed, being _\\xc3\\xa0 la_ Southampton, the middle of three\\r\\ndeep, but very lively from the frequent sound of the pestle and mortar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe afterwards called on the Miss Williamses, who lodge at Durantoy\\'s.\\r\\nMiss Mary only was at home, and she is in very indifferent health. Dr.\\r\\nHacket came in while we were there, and said that he never remembered\\r\\nsuch a severe winter as this in Southampton before. It is bad, but we do\\r\\nnot suffer as we did last year, because the wind has been more N.E. than\\r\\nN.W.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a day or two last week my mother was very poorly with a return of\\r\\none of her old complaints, but it did not last long, and seems to have\\r\\nleft nothing bad behind it. She began to talk of a serious illness, her\\r\\ntwo last having been preceded by the same symptoms, but, thank heaven!\\r\\nshe is now quite as well as one can expect her to be in weather which\\r\\ndeprives her of exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss M. conveys to us a third volume of sermons, from Hamstall, just\\r\\npublished, and which we are to like better than the two others; they are\\r\\nprofessedly practical, and for the use of country congregations. I have\\r\\njust received some verses in an unknown hand, and am desired to forward\\r\\nthem to my nephew Edward at Godmersham.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Alas! poor Brag, thou boastful game!\\r\\n    What now avails thine empty name?\\r\\n    Where now thy more distinguished fame?\\r\\n    My day is o\\'er, and thine the same,\\r\\n    For thou, like me, art thrown aside\\r\\n    At Godmersham, this Christmastide;\\r\\n    And now across the table wide\\r\\n    Each game save brag or spec. is tried.\\r\\n    Such is the mild ejaculation\\r\\n    Of tender-hearted speculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday._--I expected to have a letter from somebody to-day, but I\\r\\nhave not. Twice every day I think of a letter from Portsmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Murden has been sitting with us this morning. As yet she seems very\\r\\nwell pleased with her situation. The worst part of her being in\\r\\nSouthampton will be the necessity of one walking with her now and then,\\r\\nfor she talks so loud that one is quite ashamed; but our dining hours\\r\\nare luckily very different, which we shall take all reasonable advantage\\r\\nof.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen\\'s birthday moves the assembly to this night instead of last,\\r\\nand as it is always fully attended, Martha and I expect an amusing show.\\r\\nWe were in hopes of being independent of other companions by having the\\r\\nattendance of Mr. Austen and Captain Harwood; but as they fail us, we\\r\\nare obliged to look out for other help, and have fixed on the Wallops as\\r\\nleast likely to be troublesome. I have called on them this morning and\\r\\nfound them very willing, and I am sorry that you must wait a whole week\\r\\nfor the particulars of the evening. I propose being asked to dance by\\r\\nour acquaintance Mr. Smith, now _Captain_ Smith, who has lately\\r\\nreappeared in Southampton, but I shall decline it. He saw Charles last\\r\\nAugust.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an alarming bride Mrs. ---- must have been; such a parade is one of\\r\\nthe most immodest pieces of modesty that one can imagine. To attract\\r\\nnotice could have been her only wish. It augurs ill for her family; it\\r\\nannounces not great sense, and therefore insures boundless influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope Fanny\\'s visit is now taking place. You have said scarcely\\r\\nanything of her lately, but I trust you are as good friends as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha sends her love, and hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you when\\r\\nyou return to Southampton. You are to understand this message as being\\r\\nmerely for the sake of a message to oblige me.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                      J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry never sent his love to me in your last, but I send him mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 24).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I will give you the indulgence of a letter on\\r\\nThursday this week, instead of Friday, but I do not require you to write\\r\\nagain before Sunday, provided I may believe you and your finger going on\\r\\nquite well. Take care of your precious self; do not work too hard.\\r\\nRemember that Aunt Cassandras are quite as scarce as Miss Beverleys.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nI had the happiness yesterday of a letter from Charles, but I shall say\\r\\nas little about it as possible, because I know that excruciating Henry\\r\\nwill have had a letter likewise, to make all my intelligence valueless.\\r\\nIt was written at Bermuda on the 7th and 10th of December. All well, and\\r\\nFanny still only in expectation of being otherwise. He had taken a small\\r\\nprize in his late cruise,--a French schooner, laden with sugar; but bad\\r\\nweather parted them, and she had not yet been heard of. His cruise ended\\r\\nDecember 1st. My September letter was the latest he had received.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day three weeks you are to be in London, and I wish you better\\r\\nweather; not but that you may have worse, for we have now nothing but\\r\\nceaseless snow or rain and insufferable dirt to complain of; no\\r\\ntempestuous winds nor severity of cold. Since I wrote last we have had\\r\\nsomething of each, but it is not genteel to rip up old grievances.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou used me scandalously by not mentioning Edward Cooper\\'s sermons. I\\r\\ntell you everything, and it is unknown the mysteries you conceal from\\r\\nme; and, to add to the rest, you persevere in giving a final \"e\" to\\r\\n\"invalid,\" thereby putting it out of one\\'s power to suppose Mrs. E.\\r\\nLeigh, even for a moment, a veteran soldier. She, good woman, is, I\\r\\nhope, destined for some further placid enjoyment of her own excellence\\r\\nin this world, for her recovery advances exceedingly well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had this pleasant news in a letter from Bookham last Thursday; but as\\r\\nthe letter was from Mary instead of her mother, you will guess her\\r\\naccount was not equally good from home. Mrs. Cooke had been confined to\\r\\nher bed some days by illness, but was then better, and Mary wrote in\\r\\nconfidence of her continuing to mend. I have desired to hear again soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou rejoice me by what you say of Fanny.[12] I hope she will not turn\\r\\ngood-for-nothing this ever so long. We thought of and talked of her\\r\\nyesterday with sincere affection, and wished her a long enjoyment of all\\r\\nthe happiness to which she seems born. While she gives happiness to\\r\\nthose about her she is pretty sure of her own share.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am gratified by her having pleasure in what I write, but I wish the\\r\\nknowledge of my being exposed to her discerning criticism may not hurt\\r\\nmy style, by inducing too great a solicitude. I begin already to weigh\\r\\nmy words and sentences more than I did, and am looking about for a\\r\\nsentiment, an illustration, or a metaphor in every corner of the room.\\r\\nCould my ideas flow as fast as the rain in the store-closet, it would be\\r\\ncharming.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been in two or three dreadful states within the last week, from\\r\\nthe melting of the snow, etc., and the contest between us and the closet\\r\\nhas now ended in our defeat. I have been obliged to move almost\\r\\neverything out of it, and leave it to splash itself as it likes.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have by no means raised my curiosity after Caleb. My disinclination\\r\\nfor it before was affected, but now it is real. I do not like the\\r\\nevangelicals. Of course I shall be delighted when I read it, like other\\r\\npeople; but till I do I dislike it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sorry my verses did not bring any return from Edward. I was in\\r\\nhopes they might, but I suppose he does not rate them high enough. It\\r\\nmight be partiality, but they seemed to me purely classical,--just like\\r\\nHomer and Virgil, Ovid and Propria que Maribus.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a nice brotherly letter from Frank the other day, which, after an\\r\\ninterval of nearly three weeks, was very welcome. No orders were come on\\r\\nFriday, and none were come yesterday, or we should have heard to-day. I\\r\\nhad supposed Miss C. would share her cousin\\'s room here, but a message\\r\\nin this letter proves the contrary. I will make the garret as\\r\\ncomfortable as I can, but the possibilities of that apartment are not\\r\\ngreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother has been talking to Eliza about our future home, and she,\\r\\nmaking no difficulty at all of the sweetheart, is perfectly disposed to\\r\\ncontinue with us, but till she has written home for mother\\'s approbation\\r\\ncannot quite decide. Mother does not like to have her so far off. At\\r\\nChawton she will be nine or ten miles nearer, which I hope will have its\\r\\ndue influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Sally, she means to play John Binns with us, in her anxiety to\\r\\nbelong to our household again. Hitherto she appears a very good servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou depend upon finding all your plants dead, I hope. They look very\\r\\nill, I understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour silence on the subject of our ball makes me suppose your curiosity\\r\\ntoo great for words. We were very well entertained, and could have\\r\\nstayed longer but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey me home,\\r\\nand I did not like to keep them waiting in the cold. The room was\\r\\ntolerably full, and the ball opened by Miss Glyn. The Miss Lances had\\r\\npartners, Captain Dauvergne\\'s friend appeared in regimentals, Caroline\\r\\nMaitland had an officer to flirt with, and Mr. John Harrison was deputed\\r\\nby Captain Smith, being himself absent, to ask me to dance. Everything\\r\\nwent well, you see, especially after we had tucked Mrs. Lance\\'s\\r\\nneckerchief in behind and fastened it with a pin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a very full and agreeable account of Mr. Hammond\\'s ball from Anna\\r\\nlast night; the same fluent pen has sent similar information, I know,\\r\\ninto Kent. She seems to have been as happy as one could wish her, and\\r\\nthe complacency of her mamma in doing the honors of the evening must\\r\\nhave made her pleasure almost as great. The grandeur of the meeting was\\r\\nbeyond my hopes. I should like to have seen Anna\\'s looks and\\r\\nperformance, but that sad cropped head must have injured the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha pleases herself with believing that if I had kept her counsel you\\r\\nwould never have heard of Dr. M.\\'s late behavior, as if the very slight\\r\\nmanner in which I mentioned it could have been all on which you found\\r\\nyour judgment. I do not endeavor to undeceive her, because I wish her\\r\\nhappy, at all events, and know how highly she prizes happiness of any\\r\\nkind. She is, moreover, so full of kindness for us both, and sends you\\r\\nin particular so many good wishes about your finger, that I am willing\\r\\nto overlook a venial fault, and as Dr. M. is a clergyman, their\\r\\nattachment, however immoral, has a decorous air. Adieu, sweet You. This\\r\\nis grievous news from Spain. It is well that Dr. Moore was spared the\\r\\nknowledge of such a son\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                Yours affectionately,      J.

I wish the poor little girls\\r\\nhad better weather for their journey; they must amuse themselves with\\r\\nwatching the raindrops down the windows. Sackree, I suppose, feels quite\\r\\nbroken-hearted. I cannot have done with the weather without observing\\r\\nhow delightfully mild it is; I am sure Fanny must enjoy it with us.\\r\\nYesterday was a very blowing day; we got to church, however, which we\\r\\nhad not been able to do for two Sundays before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not at all ashamed about the name of the novel, having been guilty\\r\\nof no insult toward your handwriting; the diphthong I always saw, but\\r\\nknowing how fond you were of adding a vowel wherever you could, I\\r\\nattributed it to that alone, and the knowledge of the truth does the\\r\\nbook no service; the only merit it could have was in the name of Caleb,\\r\\nwhich has an honest, unpretending sound, but in Coelebs there is\\r\\npedantry and affectation. Is it written only to classical scholars?\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall now try to say only what is necessary, I am weary of meandering;\\r\\nso expect a vast deal of small matter, concisely told, in the next two\\r\\npages.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Cooke has been very dangerously ill, but is now, I hope, safe. I\\r\\nhad a letter last week from George, Mary being too busy to write, and at\\r\\nthat time the disorder was called of the typhus kind, and their alarm\\r\\nconsiderable, but yesterday brought me a much better account from Mary,\\r\\nthe origin of the complaint being now ascertained to be bilious, and the\\r\\nstrong medicines requisite promising to be effectual. Mrs. E. L. is so\\r\\nmuch recovered as to get into the dressing-room every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nA letter from Hamstall gives us the history of Sir Tho. Williams\\'s\\r\\nreturn. The Admiral, whoever he might he, took a fancy to the \"Neptune,\"\\r\\nand having only a worn-out 74 to offer in lieu of it, Sir Tho. declined\\r\\nsuch a command, and is come home passenger. Lucky man! to have so fair\\r\\nan opportunity of escape. I hope his wife allows herself to be happy on\\r\\nthe occasion, and does not give all her thoughts to being nervous.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great event happens this week at Hamstall in young Edward\\'s removal to\\r\\nschool. He is going to Rugby, and is very happy in the idea of it; I\\r\\nwish his happiness may last, but it will be a great change to become a\\r\\nraw school-boy from being a pompous sermon-writer and a domineering\\r\\nbrother. It will do him good, I dare say.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaroline has had a great escape from being burnt to death lately. As her\\r\\nhusband gives the account, we must believe it true. Miss Murden is\\r\\ngone,--called away by the critical state of Mrs. Pottinger who has had\\r\\nanother severe stroke, and is without sense or speech. Miss Murden\\r\\nwishes to return to Southampton if circumstances suit, but it must be\\r\\nvery doubtful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been obliged to turn away Cholles, he grew so very drunken and\\r\\nnegligent, and we have a man in his place called Thomas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha desires me to communicate something concerning herself which she\\r\\nknows will give you pleasure, as affording her very particular\\r\\nsatisfaction,--it is that she is to be in town this spring with Mrs.\\r\\nDundas. I need not dilate on the subject. You understand enough of the\\r\\nwhys and wherefores to enter into her feelings, and to be conscious that\\r\\nof all possible arrangements it is the one most acceptable to her. She\\r\\ngoes to Barton on leaving us, and the family remove to town in April.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat you tell me of Miss Sharpe is quite new, and surprises me a little;\\r\\nI feel, however, as you do. She is born, poor thing! to struggle with\\r\\nevil, and her continuing with Miss B. is, I hope, a proof that matters\\r\\nare not always so very bad between them as her letters sometimes\\r\\nrepresent.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny\\'s marriage I had heard of, and supposed you would do so too from\\r\\nSteventon, as I knew you were corresponding with Mary at the time. I\\r\\nhope she will not sully the respectable name she now bears.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour plan for Miss Curling is uncommonly considerate and friendly, and\\r\\nsuch as she must surely jump at. Edward\\'s going round by Steventon, as I\\r\\nunderstand he promises to do, can be no reasonable objection; Mrs. J.\\r\\nAusten\\'s hospitality is just of the kind to enjoy such a visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were very glad to know Aunt Fanny was in the country when we read of\\r\\nthe fire. Pray give my best compliments to the Mrs. Finches, if they are\\r\\nat Gm. I am sorry to find that Sir J. Moore has a mother living, but\\r\\nthough a very heroic son he might not be a very necessary one to her\\r\\nhappiness. Deacon Morrell may be more to Mrs. Morrell.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish Sir John had united something of the Christian with the hero in\\r\\nhis death. Thank heaven! we have had no one to care for particularly\\r\\namong the troops,--no one, in fact, nearer to us than Sir John himself.\\r\\nCol. Maitland is safe and well; his mother and sisters were of course\\r\\nanxious about him, but there is no entering much into the solicitudes of\\r\\nthat family.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother is well, and gets out when she can with the same enjoyment,\\r\\nand apparently the same strength, as hitherto. She hopes you will not\\r\\nomit begging Mrs. Seward to get the garden cropped for us, supposing she\\r\\nleaves the house too early to make the garden any object to herself. We\\r\\nare very desirous of receiving your account of the house, for your\\r\\nobservations will have a motive which can leave nothing to conjecture\\r\\nand suffer nothing from want of memory. For one\\'s own dear self, one\\r\\nascertains and remembers everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Sondes is an impudent woman to come back into her old neighborhood\\r\\nagain; I suppose she pretends never to have married before, and wonders\\r\\nhow her father and mother came to have her christened Lady Sondes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe store-closet, I hope, will never do so again, for much of the evil\\r\\nis proved to have proceeded from the gutter being choked up, and we have\\r\\nhad it cleared. We had reason to rejoice in the child\\'s absence at the\\r\\ntime of the thaw, for the nursery was not habitable. We hear of similar\\r\\ndisasters from almost everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo news from Portsmouth. We are very patient. Mrs. Charles Fowle desires\\r\\nto be kindly remembered to you.

I spent Tuesday\\r\\nin Bentinck Street. The Cookes called here and took me back, and it was\\r\\nquite a Cooke day, for the Miss Rolles paid a visit while I was there,\\r\\nand Sam Arnold dropped in to tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent plan of mine,--that\\r\\nof calling on Miss Beckford again; but from the middle of the day it\\r\\nrained incessantly. Mary and I, after disposing of her father and\\r\\nmother, went to the Liverpool Museum and the British Gallery, and I had\\r\\nsome amusement at each, though my preference for men and women always\\r\\ninclines me to attend more to the company than the sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Cooke regrets very much that she did not see you when you called;\\r\\nit was owing to a blunder among the servants, for she did not know of\\r\\nour visit till we were gone. She seems tolerably well, but the nervous\\r\\npart of her complaint, I fear, increases, and makes her more and more\\r\\nunwilling to part with Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have proposed to the latter that she should go to Chawton with me, on\\r\\nthe supposition of my travelling the Guildford road, and she, I do\\r\\nbelieve, would be glad to do it, but perhaps it may be impossible;\\r\\nunless a brother can be at home at that time, it certainly must. George\\r\\ncomes to them to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not see Theo. till late on Tuesday; he was gone to Ilford, but he\\r\\ncame back in time to show his usual nothing-meaning, harmless, heartless\\r\\ncivility. Henry, who had been confined the whole day to the bank, took\\r\\nme in his way home, and, after putting life and wit into the party for a\\r\\nquarter of an hour, put himself and his sister into a hackney coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bless my stars that I have done with Tuesday. But, alas! Wednesday was\\r\\nlikewise a day of great doings, for Manon and I took our walk to Grafton\\r\\nHouse, and I have a good deal to say on that subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sorry to tell you that I am getting very extravagant, and spending\\r\\nall my money, and, what is worse for you, I have been spending yours\\r\\ntoo; for in a linendraper\\'s shop to which I went for checked muslin, and\\r\\nfor which I was obliged to give seven shillings a yard, I was tempted by\\r\\na pretty-colored muslin, and bought ten yards of it on the chance of\\r\\nyour liking it; but at the same time, if it should not suit you, you\\r\\nmust not think yourself at all obliged to take it; it is only 3_s._\\r\\n6_d._ per yard, and I should not in the least mind keeping the whole. In\\r\\ntexture it is just what we prefer, but its resemblance to green crewels,\\r\\nI must own, is not great, for the pattern is a small red spot. And now I\\r\\nbelieve I have done all my commissions except Wedgwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nI liked my walk very much; it was shorter than I had expected, and the\\r\\nweather was delightful. We set off immediately after breakfast, and must\\r\\nhave reached Grafton House by half-past eleven; but when we entered the\\r\\nshop the whole counter was thronged, and we waited full half an hour\\r\\nbefore we could be attended to. When we were served, however, I was\\r\\nvery well satisfied with my purchases,--my bugle trimming at 2_s._ 4_d._\\r\\nand three pair silk stockings for a little less than 12_s._ a pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my way back who should I meet but Mr. Moore, just come from\\r\\nBeckenham. I believe he would have passed me if I had not made him stop,\\r\\nbut we were delighted to meet. I soon found, however, that he had\\r\\nnothing new to tell me, and then I let him go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burton has made me a very pretty little bonnet, and now nothing can\\r\\nsatisfy me but I must have a straw hat, of the riding-hat shape, like\\r\\nMrs. Tilson\\'s; and a young woman in this neighborhood is actually making\\r\\nme one. I am really very shocking, but it will not be dear at a guinea.\\r\\nOur pelisses are 17_s._ each; she charges only 8_s._ for the making, but\\r\\nthe buttons seem expensive,--are expensive, I might have said, for the\\r\\nfact is plain enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drank tea again yesterday with the Tilsons, and met the Smiths. I\\r\\nfind all these little parties very pleasant. I like Mrs. S.; Miss Beaty\\r\\nis good-humor itself, and does not seem much besides. We spend to-morrow\\r\\nevening with them, and are to meet the Coln. and Mrs. Cantelo Smith you\\r\\nhave been used to hear of, and, if she is in good humor, are likely to\\r\\nhave excellent singing.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-night I might have been at the play; Henry had kindly planned our\\r\\ngoing together to the Lyceum, but I have a cold which I should not like\\r\\nto make worse before Saturday, so I stay within all this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nEliza is walking out by herself. She has plenty of business on her hands\\r\\njust now, for the day of the party is settled, and drawing near. Above\\r\\neighty people are invited for next Tuesday evening, and there is to be\\r\\nsome very good music,--five professionals, three of them glee singers,\\r\\nbesides amateurs. Fanny will listen to this. One of the hirelings is a\\r\\nCapital on the harp, from which I expect great pleasure. The foundation\\r\\nof the party was a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry Walter, but the\\r\\nlatter leaves town the day before. I am sorry, as I wished her prejudice\\r\\nto be done away, but should have been more sorry if there had been no\\r\\ninvitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a wretch, to be so occupied with all these things as to seem to\\r\\nhave no thoughts to give to people and circumstances which really supply\\r\\na far more lasting interest,--the society in which you are; but I do\\r\\nthink of you all, I assure you, and want to know all about everybody,\\r\\nand especially about your visit to the W. Friars; _mais le moyen_ not to\\r\\nbe occupied by one\\'s own concerns?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Saturday._--Frank is superseded in the \"Caledonia.\" Henry brought us\\r\\nthis news yesterday from Mr. Daysh, and he heard at the same time that\\r\\nCharles may be in England in the course of a month. Sir Edward Pollen\\r\\nsucceeds Lord Gambier in his command, and some captain of his succeeds\\r\\nFrank; and I believe the order is already gone out. Henry means to\\r\\ninquire further to-day. He wrote to Mary on the occasion. This is\\r\\nsomething to think of. Henry is convinced that he will have the offer of\\r\\nsomething else, but does not think it will be at all incumbent on him to\\r\\naccept it; and then follows, what will he do? and where will he live?\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope to hear from you to-day. How are you as to health, strength,\\r\\nlooks, etc.? I had a very comfortable account from Chawton yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the weather permits, Eliza and I walk into London this morning. She\\r\\nis in want of chimney lights for Tuesday, and I of an ounce of\\r\\ndarning-cotton. She has resolved not to venture to the play to-night.\\r\\nThe D\\'Entraigues and Comte Julien cannot come to the party, which was at\\r\\nfirst a grief, but she has since supplied herself so well with\\r\\nperformers that it is of no consequence; their not coming has produced\\r\\nour going to them to-morrow evening, which I like the idea of. It will\\r\\nbe amusing to see the ways of a French circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote to Mrs. Hill a few days ago, and have received a most kind and\\r\\nsatisfactory answer. Any time the first week in May exactly suits her,\\r\\nand therefore I consider my going as tolerably fixed. I shall leave\\r\\nSloane Street on the 1st or 2d, and be ready for James on the 9th, and,\\r\\nif his plan alters, I can take care of myself. I have explained my views\\r\\nhere, and everything is smooth and pleasant; and Eliza talks kindly of\\r\\nconveying me to Streatham.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met the Tilsons yesterday evening, but the singing Smiths sent an\\r\\nexcuse, which put our Mrs. Smith out of humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are come back, after a good dose of walking and coaching, and I have\\r\\nthe pleasure of your letter. I wish I had James\\'s verses, but they were\\r\\nleft at Chawton. When I return thither, if Mrs. K. will give me leave, I\\r\\nwill send them to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur first object to-day was Henrietta St., to consult with Henry in\\r\\nconsequence of a very unlucky change of the play for this very\\r\\nnight,--\"Hamlet\" instead of \"King John,\"--and we are to go on Monday to\\r\\n\"Macbeth\" instead; but it is a disappointment to us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove to all.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                    JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  SLOANE ST., Thursday (April 25).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I can return the compliment by thanking you for\\r\\nthe unexpected pleasure of your letter yesterday, and as I like\\r\\nunexpected pleasure, it made me very happy; and, indeed, you need not\\r\\napologize for your letter in any respect, for it is all very fine, but\\r\\nnot too fine, I hope, to be written again, or something like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think Edward will not suffer much longer from heat; by the look of\\r\\nthings this morning I suspect the weather is rising into the balsamic\\r\\nnorth-east. It has been hot here, as you may suppose, since it was so\\r\\nhot with you, but I have not suffered from it at all, nor felt it in\\r\\nsuch a degree as to make me imagine it would be anything in the country.\\r\\nEverybody has talked of the heat, but I set it all down to London.\\r\\n\\r\\nI give you joy of our new nephew, and hope if he ever comes to be hanged\\r\\nit will not be till we are too old to care about it. It is a great\\r\\ncomfort to have it so safely and speedily over. The Miss Curlings must\\r\\nbe hard worked in writing so many letters, but the novelty of it may\\r\\nrecommend it to them; mine was from Miss Eliza, and she says that my\\r\\nbrother may arrive to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, indeed, I am never too busy to think of S. and S.[13] I can no more\\r\\nforget it than a mother can forget her sucking child; and I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for your inquiries. I have had two sheets to correct, but\\r\\nthe last only brings us to Willoughby\\'s first appearance. Mrs. K.\\r\\nregrets in the most flattering manner that she must wait till May, but I\\r\\nhave scarcely a hope of its being out in June. Henry does not neglect\\r\\nit; he has hurried the printer, and says he will see him again to-day.\\r\\nIt will not stand still during his absence, it will be sent to Eliza.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Incomes remain as they were, but I will get them altered if I can. I\\r\\nam very much gratified by Mrs. K.\\'s interest in it; and whatever may be\\r\\nthe event of it as to my credit with her, sincerely wish her curiosity\\r\\ncould be satisfied sooner than is now probable. I think she will like my\\r\\nElinor, but cannot build on anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur party went off extremely well. There were many solicitudes, alarms,\\r\\nand vexations beforehand, of course, but at last everything was quite\\r\\nright. The rooms were dressed up with flowers, etc., and looked very\\r\\npretty. A glass for the mantelpiece was lent by the man who is making\\r\\ntheir own. Mr. Egerton and Mr. Walter came at half-past five, and the\\r\\nfestivities began with a pair of very fine soles.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Mr. Walter--for he postponed his leaving London on purpose--which\\r\\ndid not give much pleasure at the time, any more than the circumstance\\r\\nfrom which it rose,--his calling on Sunday and being asked by Henry to\\r\\ntake the family dinner on that day, which he did; but it is all smoothed\\r\\nover now, and she likes him very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt half-past seven arrived the musicians in two hackney coaches, and by\\r\\neight the lordly company began to appear. Among the earliest were George\\r\\nand Mary Cooke, and I spent the greatest part of the evening very\\r\\npleasantly with them. The drawing-room being soon hotter than we liked,\\r\\nwe placed ourselves in the connecting passage, which was comparatively\\r\\ncool, and gave us all the advantage of the music at a pleasant distance,\\r\\nas well as that of the first view of every new-comer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was quite surrounded by acquaintance, especially gentlemen; and what\\r\\nwith Mr. Hampson, Mr. Seymour, Mr. W. Knatchbull, Mr. Guillemarde, Mr.\\r\\nCure, a Captain Simpson, brother to _the_ Captain Simpson, besides Mr.\\r\\nWalter and Mr. Egerton, in addition to the Cookes, and Miss Beckford,\\r\\nand Miss Middleton, I had quite as much upon my hands as I could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Miss B. has been suffering again from her old complaint, and looks\\r\\nthinner than ever. She certainly goes to Cheltenham the beginning of\\r\\nJune. We were all delight and cordiality, of course. Miss M. seems very\\r\\nhappy, but has not beauty enough to figure in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncluding everybody we were sixty-six,--which was considerably more than\\r\\nEliza had expected, and quite enough to fill the back drawing-room and\\r\\nleave a few to be scattered about in the other and in the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music was extremely good. It opened (tell Fanny) with \"Poike de Parp\\r\\npirs praise pof Prapela;\" and of the other glees I remember, \"In peace\\r\\nlove tunes,\" \"Rosabelle,\" \"The Red Cross Knight,\" and \"Poor Insect.\"\\r\\nBetween the songs were lessons on the harp, or harp and pianoforte\\r\\ntogether; and the harp-player was Wiepart, whose name seems famous,\\r\\nthough new to me. There was one female singer, a short Miss Davis, all\\r\\nin blue, bringing up for the public line, whose voice was said to be\\r\\nvery fine indeed; and all the performers gave great satisfaction by\\r\\ndoing what they were paid for, and giving themselves no airs. No amateur\\r\\ncould be persuaded to do anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was not clear till after twelve. If you wish to hear more of\\r\\nit, you must put your questions, but I seem rather to have exhausted\\r\\nthan spared the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis said Captain Simpson told us, on the authority of some other\\r\\nCaptain just arrived from Halifax, that Charles was bringing the\\r\\n\"Cleopatra\" home, and that she was probably by this time in the\\r\\nChannel; but as Captain S. was certainly in liquor, we must not quite\\r\\ndepend on it. It must give one a sort of expectation, however, and will\\r\\nprevent my writing to him any more. I would rather he should not reach\\r\\nEngland till I am at home, and the Steventon party gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother and Martha both write with great satisfaction of Anna\\'s\\r\\nbehavior. She is quite an Anna with variations, but she cannot have\\r\\nreached her last, for that is always the most flourishing and showy; she\\r\\nis at about her third or fourth, which are generally simple and pretty.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour lilacs are in leaf, ours are in bloom. The horse-chestnuts are\\r\\nquite out, and the elms almost. I had a pleasant walk in Kensington\\r\\nGardens on Sunday with Henry, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Tilson; everything was\\r\\nfresh and beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did go to the play, after all, on Saturday. We went to the Lyceum,\\r\\nand saw the \"Hypocrite,\" an old play taken from Moli\\xc3\\xa8re\\'s \"Tartuffe,\"\\r\\nand were well entertained. Dowton and Mathews were the good actors; Mrs.\\r\\nEdwin was the heroine, and her performance is just what it used to be. I\\r\\nhave no chance of seeing Mrs. Siddons; she did act on Monday, but as\\r\\nHenry was told by the box-keeper that he did not think she would, the\\r\\nplans, and all thought of it, were given up. I should particularly have\\r\\nliked seeing her in \"Constance,\" and could swear at her with little\\r\\neffort for disappointing me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry has been to the Water-Color Exhibition, which opened on Monday,\\r\\nand is to meet us there again some morning. If Eliza cannot go (and she\\r\\nhas a cold at present), Miss Beaty will be invited to be my companion.\\r\\nHenry leaves town on Sunday afternoon, but he means to write soon\\r\\nhimself to Edward, and will tell his own plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tea is this moment setting out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not have your colored muslin unless you really want it, because I am\\r\\nafraid I could not send it to the coach without giving trouble here.\\r\\n\\r\\nEliza caught her cold on Sunday in our way to the D\\'Entraigues. The\\r\\nhorses actually gibbed on this side of Hyde Park Gate: a load of fresh\\r\\ngravel made it a formidable hill to them, and they refused the collar; I\\r\\nbelieve there was a sore shoulder to irritate. Eliza was frightened, and\\r\\nwe got out, and were detained in the evening air several minutes. The\\r\\ncold is in her chest, but she takes care of herself, and I hope it may\\r\\nnot last long.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis engagement prevented Mr. Walter\\'s staying late,--he had his coffee\\r\\nand went away. Eliza enjoyed her evening very much, and means to\\r\\ncultivate the acquaintance; and I see nothing to dislike in them but\\r\\ntheir taking quantities of snuff. Monsieur, the old Count, is a very\\r\\nfine-looking man, with quiet manners, good enough for an Englishman,\\r\\nand, I believe, is a man of great information and taste. He has some\\r\\nfine paintings, which delighted Henry as much as the son\\'s music\\r\\ngratified Eliza; and among them a miniature of Philip V. of Spain, Louis\\r\\nXIV.\\'s grandson, which exactly suited my capacity. Count Julien\\'s\\r\\nperformance is very wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met only Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, and we are just now engaged to\\r\\nspend next Sunday evening at Mrs. L.\\'s, and to meet the D\\'Entraigues,\\r\\nbut M. le Comte must do without Henry. If he would but speak English, I\\r\\nwould take to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you ever mentioned the leaving off tea to Mrs. K.? Eliza has just\\r\\nspoken of it again. The benefit she has found from it in sleeping has\\r\\nbeen very great.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall write soon to Catherine to fix my day, which will be Thursday.\\r\\nWe have no engagement but for Sunday. Eliza\\'s cold makes quiet\\r\\nadvisable. Her party is mentioned in this morning\\'s paper. I am sorry to\\r\\nhear of poor Fanny\\'s state. From that quarter, I suppose, is to be the\\r\\nalloy of her happiness.

I depended upon hearing something of the evening from\\r\\nMr. W. K., and am very well satisfied with his notice of me--\"A\\r\\npleasing-looking young woman\"--that must do; one cannot pretend to\\r\\nanything better now; thankful to have it continued a few years longer!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt gives me sincere pleasure to hear of Mrs. Knight\\'s having had a\\r\\ntolerable night at last, but upon this occasion I wish she had another\\r\\nname, for the two _nights_ jingle very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have tried to get \"Self-control,\" but in vain. I should like to know\\r\\nwhat her estimate is, but am always half afraid of finding a clever\\r\\nnovel too clever, and of finding my own story and my own people all\\r\\nforestalled.\\r\\n\\r\\nEliza has just received a few lines from Henry to assure her of the good\\r\\nconduct of his mare. He slept at Uxbridge on Sunday, and wrote from\\r\\nWheatfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were not claimed by Hans Place yesterday, but are to dine there\\r\\nto-day. Mr. Tilson called in the evening, but otherwise we were quite\\r\\nalone all day; and after having been out a good deal, the change was\\r\\nvery pleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like your opinion of Miss Atten much better than I expected, and have\\r\\nnow hopes of her staying a whole twelvemonth. By this time I suppose she\\r\\nis hard at it, governing away. Poor creature! I pity her, though they\\r\\nare my nieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! yes, I remember Miss Emma Plumbtree\\'s local consequence perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I am in a dilemma, for want of an Emma,\\r\\n    Escaped from the lips of Henry Gipps.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, really, I was never much more put to it than in continuing an\\r\\nanswer to Fanny\\'s former message. What is there to be said on the\\r\\nsubject? Pery pell, or pare pey? or po; or at the most, Pi, pope, pey,\\r\\npike, pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI congratulate Edward on the Weald of Kent Canal Bill being put off till\\r\\nanother Session, as I have just had the pleasure of reading. There is\\r\\nalways something to be hoped from delay.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Between Session and Session\\r\\n    The first Prepossession\\r\\n    May rouse up the Nation,\\r\\n    And the villanous Bill\\r\\n    May be forced to lie still\\r\\n    Against wicked men\\'s will.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is poetry for Edward and his daughter. I am afraid I shall not\\r\\nhave any for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI forgot to tell you in my last that our cousin Miss Payne called in on\\r\\nSaturday, and was persuaded to stay dinner. She told us a great deal\\r\\nabout her friend Lady Cath. Brecknell, who is most happily married, and\\r\\nMr. Brecknell is very religious, and has got black whiskers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to think that Edward has a tolerable day for his drive to\\r\\nGoodnestone, and very glad to hear of his kind promise of bringing you\\r\\nto town. I hope everything will arrange itself favorably. The 16th is\\r\\nnow to be Mrs. Dundas\\'s day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI mean, if I can, to wait for your return before I have my new gown made\\r\\nup, from a notion of their making up to more advantage together; and as\\r\\nI find the muslin is not so wide as it used to be, some contrivance may\\r\\nbe necessary. I expect the skirt to require one-half breadth cut in\\r\\ngores, besides two whole breadths.\\r\\n\\r\\nEliza has not yet quite resolved on inviting Anna, but I think she will.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                                JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                           CHAWTON, Wednesday (May 29).\\r\\n\\r\\nIT was a mistake of mine, my dear Cassandra, to talk of a tenth child at\\r\\nHamstall. I had forgot there were but eight already.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour inquiry after my uncle and aunt were most happily timed, for the\\r\\nvery same post brought an account of them. They are again at Gloucester\\r\\nHouse enjoying fresh air, which they seem to have felt the want of in\\r\\nBath, and are tolerably well, but not more than tolerable. My aunt does\\r\\nnot enter into particulars, but she does not write in spirits, and we\\r\\nimagine that she has never entirely got the better of her disorder in\\r\\nthe winter. Mrs. Welby takes her out airing in her barouche, which gives\\r\\nher a headache,--a comfortable proof, I suppose, of the uselessness of\\r\\nthe new carriage when they have got it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou certainly must have heard before I can tell you that Col. Orde has\\r\\nmarried our cousin Margt. Beckford, the Marchess. of Douglas\\'s sister.\\r\\nThe papers say that her father disinherits her, but I think too well of\\r\\nan Orde to suppose that she has not a handsome independence of her own.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Chawton Cottage, from the Garden_\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTERS, 172]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chickens are all alive and fit for the table, but we save them for\\r\\nsomething grand. Some of the flower seeds are coming up very well, but\\r\\nyour mignonette makes a wretched appearance. Miss Benn has been\\r\\nequally unlucky as to hers. She had seed from four different people, and\\r\\nnone of it comes up. Our young piony at the foot of the fir-tree has\\r\\njust blown and looks very handsome, and the whole of the shrubbery\\r\\nborder will soon be very gay with pinks and sweet-williams, in addition\\r\\nto the columbines already in bloom. The syringas, too, are coming out.\\r\\nWe are likely to have a great crop of Orleans plums, but not many\\r\\ngreengages--on the standard scarcely any, three or four dozen, perhaps,\\r\\nagainst the wall. I believe I told you differently when I first came\\r\\nhome, but I can now judge better than I could then.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had a medley and satisfactory letter this morning from the\\r\\nhusband and wife at Cowes; and in consequence of what is related of\\r\\ntheir plans, we have been talking over the possibility of inviting them\\r\\nhere in their way from Steventon, which is what one should wish to do,\\r\\nand is, I dare say, what they expect, but, supposing Martha to be at\\r\\nhome, it does not seem a very easy thing to accommodate so large a\\r\\nparty. My mother offers to give up her room to Frank and Mary, but there\\r\\nwill then be only the best for two maids and three children.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey go to Steventon about the 22d, and I guess--for it is quite a\\r\\nguess--will stay there from a fortnight to three weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must not venture to press Miss Sharpe\\'s coming at present; we may\\r\\nhardly be at liberty before August.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor John Bridges! we are very sorry for his situation and for the\\r\\ndistress of the family. Lady B., is in one way severely tried. And our\\r\\nown dear brother suffers a great deal, I dare say, on the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not much to say of ourselves. Anna is nursing a cold caught in\\r\\nthe arbor at Faringdon, that she may be able to keep her engagement to\\r\\nMaria M. this evening, when I suppose she will make it worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not return from Faringdon till Sunday, when H. B. walked home\\r\\nwith her, and drank tea here. She was with the Prowtings almost all\\r\\nMonday. She went to learn to make feather trimmings of Miss Anna, and\\r\\nthey kept her to dinner, which was rather lucky, as we were called upon\\r\\nto meet Mrs. and Miss Terry the same evening at the Digweeds; and though\\r\\nAnna was of course invited too, I think it always safest to keep her\\r\\naway from the family, lest she should be doing too little or too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Terry, Mary, and Robert, with my aunt Harding and her daughter,\\r\\ncame from Dummer for a day and a night,--all very agreeable and very\\r\\nmuch delighted with the new house and with Chawton in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat upstairs, and had thunder and lightning as usual. I never knew\\r\\nsuch a spring for thunderstorms as it has been. Thank God! we have had\\r\\nno bad ones here. I thought myself in luck to have my uncomfortable\\r\\nfeelings shared by the mistress of the house, as that procured blinds\\r\\nand candles. It had been excessively hot the whole day. Mrs. Harding is\\r\\na good-looking woman, but not much like Mrs. Toke, inasmuch as she is\\r\\nvery brown and has scarcely any teeth; she seems to have some of Mrs.\\r\\nToke\\'s civility. Miss H. is an elegant, pleasing, pretty-looking girl,\\r\\nabout nineteen, I suppose, or nineteen and a half, or nineteen and a\\r\\nquarter, with flowers in her head and music at her finger-ends. She\\r\\nplays very well indeed. I have seldom heard anybody with more pleasure.\\r\\nThey were at Godington four or five years ago. My cousin Flora Long was\\r\\nthere last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy name is Diana. How does Fanny like it? What a change in the weather!\\r\\nWe have a fire again now.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet Benn sleeps at the Great House to-night, and spends to-morrow\\r\\nwith us; and the plan is that we should all walk with her to drink tea\\r\\nat Faringdon, for her mother is now recovered; but the state of the\\r\\nweather is not very promising at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Benn has been returned to her cottage since the beginning of last\\r\\nweek, and has now just got another girl; she comes from Alton. For many\\r\\ndays Miss B. had nobody with her but her niece Elizabeth, who was\\r\\ndelighted to be her visitor and her maid. They both dined here on\\r\\nSaturday while Anna was at Faringdon; and last night an accidental\\r\\nmeeting and a sudden impulse produced Miss Benn and Maria Middleton at\\r\\nour tea-table.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have not heard it is very fit you should, that Mr. Harrison has\\r\\nhad the living of Fareham given him by the Bishop, and is going to\\r\\nreside there; and now it is said that Mr. Peach (beautiful wiseacre)\\r\\nwants to have the curacy of Overton, and if he does leave Wootton, James\\r\\nDigweed wishes to go there. Fare you well.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Yours affectionately,      JANE AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chimneys at the Great House are done. Mr. Prowting has opened a\\r\\ngravel-pit, very conveniently for my mother, just at the mouth of the\\r\\napproach to his house; but it looks a little as if he meant to catch all\\r\\nhis company. Tolerable gravel.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                           CHAWTON, Thursday (June 6).\\r\\n\\r\\nBY this time, my dearest Cassandra, you know Martha\\'s plans. I was\\r\\nrather disappointed, I confess, to find that she could not leave town\\r\\ntill after ye 24th, as I had hoped to see you here the week before. The\\r\\ndelay, however, is not great, and everything seems generally arranging\\r\\nitself for your return very comfortably.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found Henry perfectly predisposed to bring you to London if agreeable\\r\\nto yourself; he has not fixed his day for going into Kent, but he must\\r\\nbe back again before ye 20th. You may therefore think with something\\r\\nlike certainty of the close of your Godmersham visit, and will have, I\\r\\nsuppose, about a week for Sloane Street. He travels in his gig, and\\r\\nshould the weather be tolerable I think you must have a delightful\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have given up all idea of Miss Sharpe\\'s travelling with you and\\r\\nMartha, for though you are both all compliance with my scheme, yet as\\r\\nyou knock off a week from the end of her visit, and Martha rather more\\r\\nfrom the beginning, the thing is out of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have written to her to say that after the middle of July we shall be\\r\\nhappy to receive her, and I have added a welcome if she could make her\\r\\nway hither directly, but I do not expect that she will. I have also sent\\r\\nour invitation to Cowes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are very sorry for the disappointment you have all had in Lady B.\\'s\\r\\nillness; but a division of the proposed party is with you by this time,\\r\\nand I hope may have brought you a better account of the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive my love and thanks to Harriot, who has written me charming things\\r\\nof your looks, and diverted me very much by poor Mrs. C. Milles\\'s\\r\\ncontinued perplexity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a few lines from Henry on Tuesday to prepare us for himself and\\r\\nhis friend, and by the time that I had made the sumptuous provision of a\\r\\nneck of mutton on the occasion, they drove into the court; but lest you\\r\\nshould not immediately recollect in how many hours a neck of mutton may\\r\\nbe certainly procured, I add that they came a little after twelve,--both\\r\\ntall and well, and in their different degrees agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a visit of only twenty-four hours, but very pleasant while it\\r\\nlasted. Mr. Tilson took a sketch of the Great House before dinner, and\\r\\nafter dinner we all three walked to Chawton Park,[14] meaning to go into\\r\\nit, but it was too dirty, and we were obliged to keep on the outside.\\r\\nMr. Tilson admired the trees very much, but grieved that they should not\\r\\nbe turned into money.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother\\'s cold is better, and I believe she only wants dry weather to\\r\\nbe very well. It was a great distress to her that Anna should be absent\\r\\nduring her uncle\\'s visit, a distress which I could not share. She does\\r\\nnot return from Faringdon till this evening, and I doubt not has had\\r\\nplenty of the miscellaneous, unsettled sort of happiness which seems to\\r\\nsuit her best. We hear from Miss Benn, who was on the Common with the\\r\\nProwtings, that she was very much admired by the gentlemen in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like your new bonnets exceedingly; yours is a shape which always looks\\r\\nwell, and I think Fanny\\'s particularly becoming to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday I had the pleasure of receiving, unpacking, and approving our\\r\\nWedgwood ware. It all came very safely, and upon the whole is a good\\r\\nmatch, though I think they might have allowed us rather larger leaves,\\r\\nespecially in such a year of fine foliage as this. One is apt to suppose\\r\\nthat the woods about Birmingham must be blighted. There was no bill with\\r\\nthe goods, but that shall not screen them from being paid. I mean to ask\\r\\nMartha to settle the account. It will be quite in her way, for she is\\r\\njust now sending my mother a breakfast-set from the same place.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope it will come by the wagon to-morrow; it is certainly what we\\r\\nwant, and I long to know what it is like, and as I am sure Martha has\\r\\ngreat pleasure in making the present, I will not have any regret. We\\r\\nhave considerable dealings with the wagons at present: a hamper of port\\r\\nand brandy from Southampton is now in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour answer about the Miss Plumbtrees proves you as fine a Daniel as\\r\\never Portia was; for I maintained Emma to be the eldest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe began pease on Sunday, but our gatherings are very small, not at all\\r\\nlike the gathering in the \"Lady of the Lake.\" Yesterday I had the\\r\\nagreeable surprise of finding several scarlet strawberries quite ripe;\\r\\nhad you been at home, this would have been a pleasure lost. There are\\r\\nmore gooseberries and fewer currants than I thought at first. We must\\r\\nbuy currants for our wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Digweeds are gone down to see the Stephen Terrys at Southampton, and\\r\\ncatch the King\\'s birthday at Portsmouth. Miss Papillon called on us\\r\\nyesterday, looking handsomer than ever. Maria Middleton and Miss Benn\\r\\ndine here to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are not to enclose any more letters to Abingdon Street, as perhaps\\r\\nMartha has told you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had just left off writing and put on my things for walking to Alton,\\r\\nwhen Anna and her friend Harriot called in their way thither; so we went\\r\\ntogether. Their business was to provide mourning against the King\\'s\\r\\ndeath, and my mother has had a bombazine bought for her. I am not sorry\\r\\nto be back again, for the young ladies had a great deal to do, and\\r\\nwithout much method in doing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna does not come home till to-morrow morning. She has written I find\\r\\nto Fanny, but there does not seem to be a great deal to relate of\\r\\nTuesday. I had hoped there might be dancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Budd died on Sunday evening. I saw her two days before her death,\\r\\nand thought it must happen soon. She suffered much from weakness and\\r\\nrestlessness almost to the last. Poor little Harriot seems truly\\r\\ngrieved. You have never mentioned Harry; how is he?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith love to you all,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours affectionately,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[14] A large beech wood extending for a long distance upon a hill about\\r\\na mile from Chawton: the trees are magnificent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  CHAWTON, Friday (January 29, 1813).\\r\\n\\r\\nI HOPE you received my little parcel by J. Bond on Wednesday evening, my\\r\\ndear Cassandra, and that you will be ready to hear from me again on\\r\\nSunday, for I feel that I must write to you to-day. I want to tell you\\r\\nthat I have got my own darling child[15] from London. On Wednesday I\\r\\nreceived one copy sent down by Falkener, with three lines from Henry to\\r\\nsay that he had given another to Charles and sent a third by the coach\\r\\nto Godmersham. . . . The advertisement is in our paper to-day for the first\\r\\ntime: 18_s._ He shall ask 1_l._ 1_s._ for my two next, and 1_l._ 8_s._\\r\\nfor my stupidest of all. Miss B. dined with us on the very day of the\\r\\nbook\\'s coming, and in the evening we fairly set at it, and read half the\\r\\nfirst vol. to her, prefacing that, having intelligence from Henry that\\r\\nsuch a work would soon appear, we had desired him to send it whenever it\\r\\ncame out, and I believe it passed with her unsuspected. She was amused,\\r\\npoor soul! _That_ she could not help, you know, with two such people to\\r\\nlead the way; but she really does seem to admire Elizabeth. I must\\r\\nconfess that I think her as delightful a creature as ever appeared in\\r\\nprint, and how I shall be able to tolerate those who do not like _her_\\r\\nat least, I do not know. There are a few typical errors; and a \"said\\r\\nhe,\" or a \"said she,\" would sometimes make the dialogue more immediately\\r\\nclear; but \"I do not write for such dull elves\" as have not a great deal\\r\\nof ingenuity themselves. The second volume is shorter than I could wish,\\r\\nbut the difference is not so much in reality as in look, there being a\\r\\nlarger proportion of narrative in that part. I have lop\\'t and crop\\'t so\\r\\nsuccessfully, however, that I imagine it must be rather shorter than\\r\\n\"Sense and Sensibility\" altogether. Now I will try and write of\\r\\nsomething else.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[15] \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      CHAWTON, Thursday (February 4).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter was truly welcome, and I am much obliged\\r\\nto you for all your praise; it came at a right time, for I had had some\\r\\nfits of disgust. Our second evening\\'s reading to Miss B. had not\\r\\npleased me so well, but I believe something must be attributed to my\\r\\nmother\\'s too rapid way of getting on: though she perfectly understands\\r\\nthe characters herself, she cannot speak as they ought. Upon the whole,\\r\\nhowever, I am quite vain enough and well satisfied enough. The work is\\r\\nrather too light and bright and sparkling: it wants shade; it wants to\\r\\nbe stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense, if it\\r\\ncould be had; if not, of solemn specious nonsense, about something\\r\\nunconnected with the story,--an essay on writing, a critique on Walter\\r\\nScott, or the history of Buonaparte, or something that would form a\\r\\ncontrast, and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness\\r\\nand epigrammatism of the general style. . . . The greatest blunder in\\r\\nthe printing that I have met with is in page 220, v. 3, where two\\r\\nspeeches are made into one. There might as well be no suppers at\\r\\nLongbourn; but I suppose it was the remains of Mrs. Bennet\\'s old Meryton\\r\\nhabits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                            FEBRUARY.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS will be a quick return for yours, my dear Cassandra. I doubt its\\r\\nhaving much else to recommend it; but there is no saying: it may turn\\r\\nout to be a very long and delightful letter. I am exceedingly pleased\\r\\nthat you can say what you do, after having gone through the whole work,\\r\\nand Fanny\\'s praise is very gratifying. My hopes were tolerably strong of\\r\\nher, but nothing like a certainty. Her liking Darcy and Elizabeth is\\r\\nenough. She might hate all the others, if she would. I have her opinion\\r\\nunder her own hand this morning; but your transcript of it, which I read\\r\\nfirst, was not, and is not, the less acceptable. To me it is of course\\r\\nall praise, but the more exact truth which she sends you is good\\r\\nenough. . . . Our party on Wednesday was not unagreeable, though we\\r\\nwanted a master of the house less anxious and fidgety, and more\\r\\nconversable. Upon Mrs. ----\\'s mentioning that she had sent the rejected\\r\\naddresses to Mrs. H., I began talking to her a little about them, and\\r\\nexpressed my hope of their having amused her. Her answer was, \"Oh dear,\\r\\nyes, very much, very droll indeed, the opening of the house, and the\\r\\nstriking up of the fiddles!\" What she meant, poor woman, who shall say?\\r\\nI sought no farther. As soon as a whist-party was formed, and a round\\r\\ntable threatened, I made my mother an excuse and came away, leaving just\\r\\nas many for their round table as there were at Mrs. Grant\\'s.[16] I wish\\r\\nthey might be as agreeable a set. My mother is very well, and finds\\r\\ngreat amusement in glove-knitting, and at present wants no other work.\\r\\nWe quite run over with books. She has got Sir John Carr\\'s \"Travels in\\r\\nSpain,\" and I am reading a Society octavo, an \"Essay on the Military\\r\\nPolice and Institutions of the British Empire,\" by Capt. Pasley of the\\r\\nEngineers,--a book which I protested against at first, but which upon\\r\\ntrial I find delightfully written and highly entertaining. I am as much\\r\\nin love with the author as I ever was with Clarkson or Buchanan, or even\\r\\nthe two Mr. Smiths of the city. The first soldier I ever sighed for; but\\r\\nhe does write with extraordinary force and spirit. Yesterday, moreover,\\r\\nbrought us \"Mrs. Grant\\'s Letters,\" with Mr. White\\'s compliments; but I\\r\\nhave disposed of them, compliments and all, to Miss P., and amongst so\\r\\nmany readers or retainers of books as we have in Chawton, I dare say\\r\\nthere will be no difficulty in getting rid of them for another\\r\\nfortnight, if necessary. I have disposed of Mrs. Grant for the second\\r\\nfortnight to Mrs. ----. It can make no difference to her which of the\\r\\ntwenty-six fortnights in the year the three vols. lie on her table. I\\r\\nhave been applied to for information as to the oath taken in former\\r\\ntimes of Bell, Book, and Candle, but have none to give. Perhaps you may\\r\\nbe able to learn something of its origin where you now are. Ladies who\\r\\nread those enormous great stupid thick quarto volumes which one always\\r\\nsees in the breakfast-parlor there must be acquainted with everything\\r\\nin the world. I detest a quarto. Captain Pasley\\'s book is too good for\\r\\ntheir society. They will not understand a man who condenses his thoughts\\r\\ninto an octavo. I have learned from Sir J. Carr that there is no\\r\\nGovernment House at Gibraltar. I must alter it to the Commissioner\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[16] At this time, February, 1813, \"Mansfield Park\" was nearly finished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                       SLOANE STREET, Thursday, May 20.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Before I say anything else, I claim a paper full of\\r\\nhalfpence on the drawing-room mantelpiece; I put them there myself, and\\r\\nforgot to bring them with me. I cannot say that I have yet been in any\\r\\ndistress for money, but I choose to have my due, as well as the Devil.\\r\\nHow lucky we were in our weather yesterday! This wet morning makes one\\r\\nmore sensible of it. We had no rain of any consequence. The head of the\\r\\ncurricle was put half up three or four times, but our share of the\\r\\nshowers was very trifling, though they seemed to be heavy all round us,\\r\\nwhen we were on the Hog\\'s-back, and I fancied it might then be raining\\r\\nso hard at Chawton as to make you feel for us much more than we\\r\\ndeserved. Three hours and a quarter took us to Guildford, where we\\r\\nstayed barely two hours, and had only just time enough for all we had\\r\\nto do there; that is, eating a long and comfortable breakfast, watching\\r\\nthe carriages, paying Mr. Harrington, and taking a little stroll\\r\\nafterwards. From some views which that stroll gave us, I think most\\r\\nhighly of the situation of Guildford. We wanted all our brothers and\\r\\nsisters to be standing with us in the bowling-green, and looking towards\\r\\nHorsham. I was very lucky in my gloves,--got them at the first shop I\\r\\nwent to, though I went into it rather because it was near than because\\r\\nit looked at all like a glove-shop, and gave only four shillings for\\r\\nthem; after which everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting\\r\\nthat they cannot be good for anything, and their worth certainly remains\\r\\nto be proved; but I think they look very well. We left Guildford at\\r\\ntwenty minutes before twelve (I hope somebody cares for these minuti\\xc3\\xa6),\\r\\nand were at Esher in about two hours more. I was very much pleased with\\r\\nthe country in general. Between Guildford and Ripley I thought it\\r\\nparticularly pretty, also about Painshill; and from a Mr. Spicer\\'s\\r\\ngrounds at Esher, which we walked into before dinner, the views were\\r\\nbeautiful. I cannot say what we did _not_ see, but I should think there\\r\\ncould not be a wood, or a meadow, or palace, or remarkable spot in\\r\\nEngland that was not spread out before us on one side or other.\\r\\nClaremont is going to be sold: a Mr. Ellis has it now. It is a house\\r\\nthat seems never to have prospered. After dinner we walked forward to be\\r\\novertaken at the coachman\\'s time, and before he did overtake us we were\\r\\nvery near Kingston. I fancy it was about half-past six when we reached\\r\\nthis house,--a twelve hours\\' business, and the horses did not appear\\r\\nmore than reasonably tired. I was very tired too, and glad to get to bed\\r\\nearly, but am quite well to-day. I am very snug in the front\\r\\ndrawing-room all to myself, and would not say \"thank you\" for any\\r\\ncompany but you. The quietness of it does me good. I have contrived to\\r\\npay my two visits, though the weather made me a great while about it,\\r\\nand left me only a few minutes to sit with Charlotte Craven.[17] She\\r\\nlooks very well, and her hair is done up with an elegance to do credit\\r\\nto any education. Her manners are as unaffected and pleasing as ever.\\r\\nShe had heard from her mother to-day. Mrs. Craven spends another\\r\\nfortnight at Chilton. I saw nobody but Charlotte, which pleased me best.\\r\\nI was shown upstairs into a drawing-room, where she came to me; and the\\r\\nappearance of the room, so totally unschoollike, amused me very much: it\\r\\nwas full of modern elegances.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affec^{tly},\\r\\n                                                      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[17] The present Lady Pollen, of Redenham, near Andover, then at a\\r\\nschool in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      SLOANE STREET, Monday (May 24).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I am very much obliged to you for writing to me.\\r\\nYou must have hated it after a worrying morning. Your letter came just\\r\\nin time to save my going to Remnant\\'s, and fit me for Christian\\'s, where\\r\\nI bought Fanny\\'s dimity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went the day before (Friday) to Layton\\'s as I proposed, and got my\\r\\nmother\\'s gown,--seven yards at 6_s._ 6_d._ I then walked into No. 10,\\r\\nwhich is all dirt and confusion, but in a very promising way; and after\\r\\nbeing present at the opening of a new account, to my great amusement,\\r\\nHenry and I went to the exhibition in Spring Gardens. It is not thought\\r\\na good collection, but I was very well pleased, particularly (pray tell\\r\\nFanny) with a small portrait of Mrs. Bingley,[1] excessively like her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there was no Mrs.\\r\\nDarcy.[18] Perhaps, however, I may find her in the great exhibition,\\r\\nwhich we shall go to if we have time. I have no chance of her in the\\r\\ncollection of Sir Joshua Reynolds\\'s paintings, which is now showing in\\r\\nPall Mall, and which we are also to visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bingley\\'s is exactly herself,--size, shaped face, features, and\\r\\nsweetness; there never was a greater likeness. She is dressed in a white\\r\\ngown, with green ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\\r\\nsupposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I dare say Mrs. D.\\r\\nwill be in yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday was our worst day as to weather. We were out in a very long and\\r\\nvery heavy storm of hail, and there had been others before, but I heard\\r\\nno thunder. Saturday was a good deal better; dry and cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave 2_s._ 6_d._ for the dimity. I do not boast of any bargains, but\\r\\nthink both the sarsenet and dimity good of their sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have bought your locket, but was obliged to give 18_s._ for it, which\\r\\nmust be rather more than you intended. It is neat and plain, set in\\r\\ngold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were to have gone to the Somerset House Exhibition on Saturday, but\\r\\nwhen I reached Henrietta Street Mr. Hampson was wanted there, and Mr.\\r\\nTilson and I were obliged to drive about town after him, and by the time\\r\\nwe had done it was too late for anything but home. We never found him\\r\\nafter all.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been interrupted by Mrs. Tilson. Poor woman! She is in danger of\\r\\nnot being able to attend Lady Drummond Smith\\'s party to-night. Miss\\r\\nBurdett was to have taken her, and now Miss Burdett has a cough and\\r\\nwill not go. My cousin Caroline is her sole dependence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events of yesterday were, our going to Belgrave Chapel in the\\r\\nmorning, our being prevented by the rain from going to evening service\\r\\nat St. James, Mr. Hampson\\'s calling, Messrs. Barlow and Phillips dining\\r\\nhere, and Mr. and Mrs. Tilson\\'s coming in the evening _\\xc3\\xa0 l\\'ordinaire_.\\r\\nShe drank tea with us both Thursday and Saturday; he dined out each day,\\r\\nand on Friday we were with them, and they wish us to go to them\\r\\nto-morrow evening, to meet Miss Burdett, but I do not know how it will\\r\\nend. Henry talks of a drive to Hampstead, which may interfere with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should like to see Miss Burdett very well, but that I am rather\\r\\nfrightened by hearing that she wishes to be introduced to me. If I am a\\r\\nwild beast, I cannot help it. It is not my own fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no change in our plan of leaving London, but we shall not be\\r\\nwith you before Tuesday. Henry thinks Monday would appear too early a\\r\\nday. There is no danger of our being induced to stay longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not quite determined how I shall manage about my clothes; perhaps\\r\\nthere may be only my trunk to send by the coach, or there may be a\\r\\nband-box with it. I have taken your gentle hint, and written to Mrs.\\r\\nHill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hoblyns want us to dine with them, but we have refused. When Henry\\r\\nreturns he will be dining out a great deal, I dare say; as he will then\\r\\nbe alone, it will be more desirable; he will be more welcome at every\\r\\ntable, and every invitation more welcome to him. He will not want either\\r\\nof us again till he is settled in Henrietta Street. This is my present\\r\\npersuasion. And he will not be settled there--really settled--till late\\r\\nin the autumn; \"he will not be come to bide\" till after September.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a gentleman in treaty for this house. Gentleman himself is in\\r\\nthe country, but gentleman\\'s friend came to see it the other day, and\\r\\nseemed pleased on the whole. Gentleman would rather prefer an increased\\r\\nrent to parting with five hundred guineas at once, and if that is the\\r\\nonly difficulty it will not be minded. Henry is indifferent as to the\\r\\nwhich.\\r\\n\\r\\nGet us the best weather you can for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We\\r\\nare to go to Windsor in our way to Henley, which will be a great\\r\\ndelight. We shall be leaving Sloane Street about twelve, two or three\\r\\nhours after Charles\\'s party have begun their journey. You will miss\\r\\nthem, but the comfort of getting back into your own room will be great.\\r\\nAnd then the tea and sugar!\\r\\n\\r\\nI fear Miss Clewes is not better, or you would have mentioned it. I\\r\\nshall not write again unless I have any unexpected communication or\\r\\nopportunity to tempt me. I enclose Mr. Herington\\'s bill and receipt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very much obliged to Fanny for her letter; it made me laugh\\r\\nheartily, but I cannot pretend to answer it. Even had I more time, I\\r\\nshould not feel at all sure of the sort of letter that Miss D.[19] would\\r\\nwrite. I hope Miss Benn is got well again, and will have a comfortable\\r\\ndinner with you to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Monday Evening._--We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\\r\\nReynolds\\'s, and I am disappointed, for there was nothing like Mrs. D. at\\r\\neither. I can only imagine that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too\\r\\nmuch to like it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine he\\r\\nwould have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of love, pride, and\\r\\ndelicacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting aside this disappointment, I had great amusement among the\\r\\npictures; and the driving about, the carriage being open, was very\\r\\npleasant. I liked my solitary elegance very much, and was ready to laugh\\r\\nall the time at my being where I was. I could not but feel that I had\\r\\nnaturally small right to be parading about London in a barouche.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry desires Edward may know that he has just bought three dozen of\\r\\nclaret for him (cheap), and ordered it to be sent down to Chawton.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should not wonder if we got no farther than Reading on Thursday\\r\\nevening, and so reach Steventon only to a reasonable dinner-hour the\\r\\nnext day; but whatever I may write or you may imagine, we know it will\\r\\nbe something different. I shall be quiet to-morrow morning; all my\\r\\nbusiness is done, and I shall only call again upon Mrs. Hoblyn, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove to your much . . . party.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                     J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[18] _Vide_ \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[19] Miss Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                         HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (Sept. 15, \\xc2\\xbd past 8).\\r\\n\\r\\nHERE I am, my dearest Cassandra, seated in the breakfast, dining,\\r\\nsitting room, beginning with all my might. Fanny will join me as soon as\\r\\nshe is dressed, and begin her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a very good journey, weather and roads excellent; the three first\\r\\nstages for 1_s._ 6_d._, and our only misadventure the being delayed\\r\\nabout a quarter of an hour at Kingston for horses, and being obliged to\\r\\nput up with a pair belonging to a hackney coach and their coachman,\\r\\nwhich left no room on the barouche box for Lizzy, who was to have gone\\r\\nher last stage there as she did the first; consequently we were all\\r\\nfour within, which was a little crowded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived at a quarter-past four, and were kindly welcomed by the\\r\\ncoachman, and then by his master, and then by William, and then by Mrs.\\r\\nPengird, who all met us before we reached the foot of the stairs. Mde.\\r\\nBigion was below dressing us a most comfortable dinner of soup, fish,\\r\\nbouill\\xc3\\xa9e, partridges, and an apple tart, which we sat down to soon after\\r\\nfive, after cleaning and dressing ourselves, and feeling that we were\\r\\nmost commodiously disposed of. The little adjoining dressing-room to our\\r\\napartment makes Fanny and myself very well off indeed, and as we have\\r\\npoor Eliza\\'s[20] bed our space is ample every way.\\r\\n\\r\\nSace arrived safely about half-past six. At seven we set off in a coach\\r\\nfor the Lyceum; were at home again in about four hours and a half; had\\r\\nsoup and wine and water, and then went to our holes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward finds his quarters very snug and quiet. I must get a softer pen.\\r\\nThis is harder. I am in agonies. I have not yet seen Mr. Crabbe.\\r\\nMartha\\'s letter is gone to the post.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am going to write nothing but short sentences. There shall be two full\\r\\nstops in every line. Layton and Shear\\'s is Bedford House. We mean to\\r\\nget there before breakfast if it\\'s possible; for we feel more and more\\r\\nhow much we have to do and how little time. This house looks very nice.\\r\\nIt seems like Sloane Street moved here. I believe Henry is just rid of\\r\\nSloane Street. Fanny does not come, but I have Edward seated by me\\r\\nbeginning a letter, which looks natural.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry has been suffering from the pain in the face which he has been\\r\\nsubject to before. He caught cold at Matlock, and since his return has\\r\\nbeen paying a little for past pleasure. It is nearly removed now, but he\\r\\nlooks thin in the face, either from the pain or the fatigues of his\\r\\ntour, which must have been great.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Robert is delighted with P. and P.,[21] and really was so, as I\\r\\nunderstand, before she knew who wrote it, for of course she knows now.\\r\\nHe told her with as much satisfaction as if it were my wish. He did not\\r\\ntell me this, but he told Fanny. And Mr. Hastings! I am quite delighted\\r\\nwith what such a man writes about it. Henry sent him the books after his\\r\\nreturn from Daylesford, but you will hear the letter too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be rational, and return to my two full stops.\\r\\n\\r\\nI talked to Henry at the play last night. We were in a private box,--Mr.\\r\\nSpencer\\'s,--which made it much more pleasant. The box is directly on\\r\\nthe stage. One is infinitely less fatigued than in the common way. But\\r\\nHenry\\'s plans are not what one could wish. He does not mean to be at\\r\\nChawton till the 29th. He must be in town again by Oct. 5. His plan is\\r\\nto get a couple of days of pheasant shooting and then return directly.\\r\\nHis wish was to bring you back with him. I have told him your scruples.\\r\\nHe wishes you to suit yourself as to time, and if you cannot come till\\r\\nlater, will send for you at any time as far as Bagshot. He presumed you\\r\\nwould not find difficulty in getting so far. I could not say you would.\\r\\nHe proposed your going with him into Oxfordshire. It was his own thought\\r\\nat first. I could not but catch at it for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have talked of it again this morning (for now we have breakfasted),\\r\\nand I am convinced that if you can make it suit in other respects you\\r\\nneed not scruple on his account. If you cannot come back with him on the\\r\\n3rd or 4th, therefore, I do hope you will contrive to go to Adlestrop.\\r\\nBy not beginning your absence till about the middle of this month I\\r\\nthink you may manage it very well. But you will think all this over. One\\r\\ncould wish he had intended to come to you earlier, but it cannot be\\r\\nhelped.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said nothing to him of Mrs. H. and Miss B., that he might not suppose\\r\\ndifficulties. Shall not you put them into our own room? This seems to\\r\\nme the best plan, and the maid will be most conveniently near.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, dear me! when I shall ever have done. We did go to Layton and\\r\\nShear\\'s before breakfast. Very pretty English poplins at 4_s._ 3_d._;\\r\\nIrish, ditto at 6_s._; more pretty, certainly,--beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny and the two little girls are gone to take places for to-night at\\r\\nCovent Garden; \"Clandestine Marriage\" and \"Midas.\" The latter will be a\\r\\nfine show for L. and M.[22] They revelled last night in \"Don Juan,\" whom\\r\\nwe left in hell at half-past eleven. We had scaramouch and a ghost, and\\r\\nwere delighted. I speak of them; my delight was very tranquil, and the\\r\\nrest of us were sober-minded. \"Don Juan\" was the last of three musical\\r\\nthings. \"Five Hours at Brighton,\" in three acts,--of which one was over\\r\\nbefore we arrived, none the worse,--and the \"Beehive,\" rather less flat\\r\\nand trumpery.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have this moment received 5_l._ from kind, beautiful Edward. Fanny has\\r\\na similar gift. I shall save what I can of it for your better leisure in\\r\\nthis place. My letter was from Miss Sharpe,--nothing particular. A\\r\\nletter from Fanny Cage this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Four o\\'clock._--We are just come back from doing Mrs. Tickars, Miss\\r\\nHare, and Mr. Spence. Mr. Hall is here, and while Fanny is under his\\r\\nhands, I will try to write a little more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hare had some pretty caps, and is to make me one like one of them,\\r\\nonly white satin instead of blue. It will be white satin and lace, and a\\r\\nlittle white flower perking out of the left ear, like Harriot Byron\\'s\\r\\nfeather. I have allowed her to go as far as 1_l._ 16_s._ My gown is to\\r\\nbe trimmed everywhere with white ribbon plaited on somehow or other. She\\r\\nsays it will look well. I am not sanguine. They trim with white very\\r\\nmuch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI learnt from Mrs. Tickars\\'s young lady, to my high amusement, that the\\r\\nstays now are not made to force the bosom up at all; that was a very\\r\\nunbecoming, unnatural fashion. I was really glad to hear that they are\\r\\nnot to be so much off the shoulders as they were.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to Mr. Spence\\'s was a sad business, and cost us many tears;\\r\\nunluckily we were obliged to go a second time before he could do more\\r\\nthan just look. We went first at half-past twelve and afterwards at\\r\\nthree; papa with us each time; and, alas! we are to go again to-morrow.\\r\\nLizzy is not finished yet. There have been no teeth taken out, however,\\r\\nnor will be, I believe; but he finds hers in a very bad state, and seems\\r\\nto think particularly ill of their durableness. They have been all\\r\\ncleaned, hers filed, and are to be filed again. There is a very sad hole\\r\\nbetween two of her front teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Thursday Morning, half-past Seven._--Up and dressed and downstairs in\\r\\norder to finish my letter in time for the parcel. At eight I have an\\r\\nappointment with Madame B., who wants to show me something downstairs.\\r\\nAt nine we are to set off for Grafton House, and get that over before\\r\\nbreakfast. Edward is so kind as to walk there with us. We are to be at\\r\\nMr. Spence\\'s again at 11.5: from that time shall be driving about I\\r\\nsuppose till four o\\'clock at least. We are, if possible, to call on Mrs.\\r\\nTilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hall was very punctual yesterday, and curled me out at a great rate.\\r\\nI thought it looked hideous, and longed for a snug cap instead, but my\\r\\ncompanions silenced me by their admiration. I had only a bit of velvet\\r\\nround my head. I did not catch cold, however. The weather is all in my\\r\\nfavor. I have had no pain in my face since I left you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had very good places in the box next the stage-box, front and second\\r\\nrow; the three old ones behind, of course. I was particularly\\r\\ndisappointed at seeing nothing of Mr. Crabbe. I felt sure of him when I\\r\\nsaw that the boxes were fitted up with crimson velvet. The new Mr. Terry\\r\\nwas Lord Ogleby, and Henry thinks he may do; but there was no acting\\r\\nmore than moderate, and I was as much amused by the remembrances\\r\\nconnected with \"Midas\" as with any part of it. The girls were very much\\r\\ndelighted, but still prefer \"Don Juan;\" and I must say that I have seen\\r\\nnobody on the stage who has been a more interesting character than that\\r\\ncompound of cruelty and lust.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not possible for me to get the worsteds yesterday. I heard Edward\\r\\nlast night pressing Henry to come to you, and I think Henry engaged to\\r\\ngo there after his November collection. Nothing has been done as to S.\\r\\nand S.[23] The books came to hand too late for him to have time for it\\r\\nbefore he went. Mr. Hastings never hinted at Eliza in the smallest\\r\\ndegree. Henry knew nothing of Mr. Trimmer\\'s death. I tell you these\\r\\nthings that you may not have to ask them over again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a new clerk sent down to Alton, a Mr. Edmund Williams, a young\\r\\nman whom Henry thinks most highly of, and he turns out to be a son of\\r\\nthe luckless Williamses of Grosvenor Place.\\r\\n\\r\\nI long to have you hear Mr. H.\\'s opinion of P. and P. His admiring my\\r\\nElizabeth so much is particularly welcome to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of saving my superfluous wealth for you to spend, I am going to\\r\\ntreat myself with spending it myself. I hope, at least, that I shall\\r\\nfind some poplin at Layton and Shear\\'s that will tempt me to buy it. If\\r\\nI do, it shall be sent to Chawton, as half will be for you; for I depend\\r\\nupon your being so kind as to accept it, being the main point. It will\\r\\nbe a great pleasure to me. Don\\'t say a word. I only wish you could\\r\\nchoose too. I shall send twenty yards.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow for Bath. Poor F. Cage has suffered a good deal from her accident.\\r\\nThe noise of the White Hart was terrible to her. They will keep her\\r\\nquiet, I dare say. She is not so much delighted with the place as the\\r\\nrest of the party; probably, as she says herself, from having been less\\r\\nwell, but she thinks she should like it better in the season. The\\r\\nstreets are very empty now, and the shops not so gay as she expected.\\r\\nThey are at No. 1 Henrietta Street, the corner of Laura Place, and have\\r\\nno acquaintance at present but the Bramstons.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bridges drinks at the Cross Bath, her son at the Hot, and Louisa is\\r\\ngoing to bathe. Dr. Parry seems to be half starving Mr. Bridges, for he\\r\\nis restricted to much such a diet as James\\'s, bread, water and meat, and\\r\\nis never to eat so much of that as he wishes, and he is to walk a great\\r\\ndeal,--walk till he drops, I believe,--gout or no gout. It really is to\\r\\nthat purpose. I have not exaggerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharming weather for you and us, and the travellers, and everybody. You\\r\\nwill take your walk this afternoon, and . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n  Henrietta Street, the autumn of 1813.\\r\\n    Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.\\r\\n      By favor of Mr. Gray.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[20] Eliza, Henry Austen\\'s first wife, who had died in the earlier part\\r\\nof this year.\\r\\n\\r\\n[21] \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[22] Lizzy and Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n[23] \"Sense and Sensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               HENRIETTA STREET,\\r\\n                                     Thursday (Sept. 16, after dinner),\\r\\n\\r\\nTHANK you, my dearest Cassandra, for the nice long letter I sent off\\r\\nthis morning. I hope you have had it by this time, and that it has found\\r\\nyou all well, and my mother no more in need of leeches. Whether this\\r\\nwill be delivered to you by Henry on Saturday evening, or by the postman\\r\\non Sunday morning, I know not, as he has lately recollected something of\\r\\nan engagement for Saturday, which perhaps may delay his visit. He seems\\r\\ndetermined to come to you soon, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you will receive the gown to-morrow, and may be able with\\r\\ntolerable honesty to say that you like the color. It was bought at\\r\\nGrafton House, where, by going very early, we got immediate attendance\\r\\nand went on very comfortably. I only forgot the one particular thing\\r\\nwhich I had always resolved to buy there,--a white silk\\r\\nhandkerchief,--and was therefore obliged to give six shillings for one\\r\\nat Crook and Besford\\'s; which reminds me to say that the worsteds ought\\r\\nalso to be at Chawton to-morrow, and that I shall be very happy to hear\\r\\nthey are approved. I had not much time for deliberation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now all four of us young ladies sitting round the circular table\\r\\nin the inner room writing our letters, while the two brothers are\\r\\nhaving a comfortable coze in the room adjoining. It is to be a quiet\\r\\nevening, much to the satisfaction of four of the six. My eyes are quite\\r\\ntired of dust and lamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter you forwarded from Edward, junr., has been duly received. He\\r\\nhas been shooting most prosperously at home, and dining at Chilham\\r\\nCastle and with Mr. Scudamore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cap is come home, and I like it very much. Fanny has one also; hers\\r\\nis white sarsenet and lace, of a different shape from mine, more fit for\\r\\nmorning carriage wear, which is what it is intended for, and is in shape\\r\\nexceedingly like our own satin and lace of last winter; shaped round the\\r\\nface exactly like it, with pipes and more fulness, and a round crown\\r\\ninserted behind. My cap has a peak in front. Large full bows of very\\r\\nnarrow ribbon (old twopenny) are the thing. One over the right temple,\\r\\nperhaps, and another at the left ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry is not quite well. His stomach is rather deranged. You must keep\\r\\nhim in rhubarb, and give him plenty of port and water. He caught his\\r\\ncold farther back than I told you,--before he got to Matlock, somewhere\\r\\nin his journey from the North; but the ill effects of that I hope are\\r\\nnearly gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned from Grafton House only just in time for breakfast, and had\\r\\nscarcely finished breakfast when the carriage came to the door. From\\r\\neleven to half-past three we were hard at it; we did contrive to get to\\r\\nHans Place for ten minutes. Mrs. T. was as affectionate and pleasing as\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter our return Mr. Tilson walked up from the Compting House and called\\r\\nupon us, and these have been all our visitings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have rejoiced more than once that I bought my writing-paper in the\\r\\ncountry; we have not had a quarter of an hour to spare.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enclose the eighteen-pence due to my mother. The rose color was 6_s._\\r\\nand the other 4_s._ per yard. There was but two yards and a quarter of\\r\\nthe dark slate in the shop, but the man promised to match it and send it\\r\\noff correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny bought her Irish at Newton\\'s in Leicester Square, and I took the\\r\\nopportunity of thinking about your Irish, and seeing one piece of the\\r\\nyard wide at 4_s._, and it seemed to me very good; good enough for your\\r\\npurpose. It might at least be worth your while to go there, if you have\\r\\nno other engagements. Fanny is very much pleased with the stockings she\\r\\nhas bought of Remmington, silk at 12_s._, cotton at 4_s._ 3_d._ She\\r\\nthinks them great bargains, but I have not seen them yet, as my hair was\\r\\ndressing when the man and the stockings came.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor girls and their teeth! I have not mentioned them yet, but we\\r\\nwere a whole hour at Spence\\'s, and Lizzy\\'s were filed and lamented over\\r\\nagain, and poor Marianne had two taken out after all, the two just\\r\\nbeyond the eye teeth, to make room for those in front. When her doom was\\r\\nfixed, Fanny, Lizzy, and I walked into the next room, where we heard\\r\\neach of the two sharp and hasty screams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girls\\' teeth I can suppose in a critical state, but I think\\r\\nhe must be a lover of teeth and money and mischief, to parade about\\r\\nFanny\\'s. I would not have had him look at mine for a shilling a tooth\\r\\nand double it. It was a disagreeable hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe then went to Wedgwood\\'s, where my brother and Fanny chose a\\r\\ndinner-set. I believe the pattern is a small lozenge in purple, between\\r\\nlines of narrow gold, and it is to have the crest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must have been three-quarters of an hour at Grafton House, Edward\\r\\nsitting by all the time with wonderful patience. There Fanny bought the\\r\\nnet for Anna\\'s gown, and a beautiful square veil for herself. The edging\\r\\nthere is very cheap. I was tempted by some, and I bought some very nice\\r\\nplaiting lace at 3_s._ 4_d._\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny desires me to tell Martha, with her kind love, that Birchall\\r\\nassured her there was no second set of Hook\\'s Lessons for Beginners, and\\r\\nthat, by my advice, she has therefore chosen her a set by another\\r\\ncomposer. I thought she would rather have something than not. It costs\\r\\nsix shillings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith love to you all, including Triggs, I remain,\\r\\n\\r\\n                            Yours very affectionately,       J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Henrietta St., autumn of 1813.\\r\\n    Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.\\r\\n      By favor of\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLVII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Thursday (Sept. 23).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Thank you five hundred and forty times for the\\r\\nexquisite piece of workmanship which was brought into the room this\\r\\nmorning, while we were at breakfast, with some very inferior works of\\r\\nart in the same way, and which I read with high glee, much delighted\\r\\nwith everything it told, whether good or bad. It is so rich in striking\\r\\nintelligence that I hardly know what to reply to first. I believe finery\\r\\nmust have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am extremely glad that you like the poplin. I thought it would have my\\r\\nmother\\'s approbation, but was not so confident of yours. Remember that\\r\\nit is a present. Do not refuse me. I am very rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Clement is very welcome to her little boy, and to my\\r\\ncongratulations into the bargain, if ever you think of giving them. I\\r\\nhope she will do well. Her sister in Lucina, Mrs. H. Gipps, does too\\r\\nwell, we think. Mary P. wrote on Sunday that she had been three days on\\r\\nthe sofa. Sackree does not approve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, there is some comfort in the Mrs. Hulbart\\'s not coming to you, and\\r\\nI am happy to hear of the honey. I was thinking of it the other day. Let\\r\\nme know when you begin the new tea and the new white wine. My present\\r\\nelegances have not yet made me indifferent to such matters. I am still a\\r\\ncat if I see a mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad you like our caps, but Fanny is out of conceit with hers\\r\\nalready; she finds that she has been buying a new cap without having a\\r\\nnew pattern, which is true enough. She is rather out of luck to like\\r\\nneither her gown nor her cap, but I do not much mind it, because besides\\r\\nthat I like them both myself, I consider it as a thing of course at her\\r\\ntime of life,--one of the sweet taxes of youth to choose in a hurry and\\r\\nmake bad bargains.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote to Charles yesterday, and Fanny has had a letter from him\\r\\nto-day, principally to make inquiries about the time of their visit\\r\\nhere, to which mine was an answer beforehand; so he will probably write\\r\\nagain soon to fix his week. I am best pleased that Cassy does not go to\\r\\nyou.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what have we been doing since I wrote last? The Mr. K.\\'s[24] came a\\r\\nlittle before dinner on Monday, and Edward went to the church with the\\r\\ntwo seniors, but there is no inscription yet drawn up. They are very\\r\\ngood-natured, you know, and civil, and all that, but are not\\r\\nparticularly superfine; however, they ate their dinner and drank their\\r\\ntea, and went away, leaving their lovely Wadham in our arms, and I wish\\r\\nyou had seen Fanny and me running backwards and forwards with his\\r\\nbreeches from the little chintz to the white room before we went to bed,\\r\\nin the greatest of frights lest he should come upon us before we had\\r\\ndone it all. There had been a mistake in the housemaid\\'s preparation,\\r\\nand they were gone to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seems a very harmless sort of young man, nothing to like or dislike\\r\\nin him,--goes out shooting or hunting with the two others all the\\r\\nmorning, and plays at whist and makes queer faces in the evening. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[24] Knatchbulls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Monday (Oct. 11).\\r\\n\\r\\n[MY DEAREST AUNT CASS.,--I have just asked Aunt Jane to let me write a\\r\\nlittle in her letter, but she does not like it, so I won\\'t. Good-by!]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will have Edward\\'s letter to-morrow. He tells me that he did not\\r\\nsend you any news to interfere with mine, but I do not think there is\\r\\nmuch for anybody to send at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had our dinner-party on Wednesday, with the addition of Mrs. and Miss\\r\\nMilles, who were under a promise of dining here in their return from\\r\\nEastwell, whenever they paid their visit of duty there, and it happened\\r\\nto be paid on that day. Both mother and daughter are much as I have\\r\\nalways found them. I like the mother--first, because she reminds me of\\r\\nMrs. Birch; and, secondly, because she is cheerful and grateful for what\\r\\nshe is at the age of ninety and upwards. The day was pleasant enough. I\\r\\nsat by Mr. Chisholme, and we talked away at a great rate about nothing\\r\\nworth hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a mistake as to the day of the Sherers going being fixed; they\\r\\nare ready, but are waiting for Mr. Paget\\'s answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI inquired of Mrs. Milles after Jemima Brydges, and was quite grieved to\\r\\nhear that she was obliged to leave Canterbury some months ago on account\\r\\nof her debts, and is nobody knows where. What an unprosperous family!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday, soon after breakfast, Mr. J. P. left us for Norton Court. I\\r\\nlike him very much. He gives me the idea of a very amiable young man,\\r\\nonly too diffident to be so agreeable as he might be. He was out the\\r\\nchief of each morning with the other two, shooting and getting wet\\r\\nthrough. To-morrow we are to know whether he and a hundred young ladies\\r\\nwill come here for the ball. I do not much expect any.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deedes cannot meet us; they have engagements at home. I will finish\\r\\nthe Deedes by saying that they are not likely to come here till quite\\r\\nlate in my stay,--the very last week perhaps; and I do not expect to see\\r\\nthe Moores at all. They are not solicited till after Edward\\'s return\\r\\nfrom Hampshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonday, November 15, is the day now fixed for our setting out.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Basingstoke races! There seem to have been two particularly\\r\\nwretched days on purpose for them; and Weyhill week does not begin much\\r\\nhappier.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were quite surprised by a letter from Anna at Tollard Royal, last\\r\\nSaturday; but perfectly approve her going, and only regret they should\\r\\nall go so far to stay so few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had thunder and lightning here on Thursday morning, between five and\\r\\nseven; no very bad thunder, but a great deal of lightning. It has given\\r\\nthe commencement of a season of wind and rain, and perhaps for the next\\r\\nsix weeks we shall not have two dry days together.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizzy is very much obliged to you for your letter and will answer it\\r\\nsoon, but has so many things to do that it may be four or five days\\r\\nbefore she can. This is quite her own message, spoken in rather a\\r\\ndesponding tone. Your letter gave pleasure to all of us; we had all the\\r\\nreading of it of course,--I three times, as I undertook, to the great\\r\\nrelief of Lizzy, to read it to Sackree, and afterwards to Louisa.\\r\\n\\r\\nSackree does not at all approve of Mary Doe and her nuts,--on the score\\r\\nof propriety rather than health. She saw some signs of going after her\\r\\nin George and Henry, and thinks if you could give the girl a check, by\\r\\nrather reproving her for taking anything seriously about nuts which they\\r\\nsaid to her, it might be of use. This, of course, is between our three\\r\\ndiscreet selves, a scene of triennial bliss.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Breton called here on Saturday. I never saw her before. She is a\\r\\nlarge, ungenteel woman, with self-satisfied and would-be elegant\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are certain of some visitors to-morrow. Edward Bridges comes for two\\r\\nnights in his way from Lenham to Ramsgate, and brings a friend--name\\r\\nunknown--but supposed to be a Mr. Harpur, a neighboring clergyman; and\\r\\nMr. R. Mascall is to shoot with the young men, which it is to be\\r\\nsupposed will end in his staying dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, Mr. Lushington, M.P. for Canterbury, and manager of the\\r\\nLodge Hounds, dines here, and stays the night. He is chiefly young\\r\\nEdward\\'s acquaintance. If I can I will get a frank from him, and write\\r\\nto you all the sooner. I suppose the Ashford ball will furnish\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wrote of my nephews with a little bitterness in my last, I think\\r\\nit particularly incumbent on me to do them justice now, and I have great\\r\\npleasure in saying that they were both at the Sacrament yesterday. After\\r\\nhaving much praised or much blamed anybody, one is generally sensible of\\r\\nsomething just the reverse soon afterwards. Now these two boys who are\\r\\nout with the foxhounds will come home and disgust me again by some habit\\r\\nof luxury or some proof of sporting mania, unless I keep it off by this\\r\\nprediction. They amuse themselves very comfortably in the evening by\\r\\nnetting; they are each about a rabbit net, and sit as deedily to it,\\r\\nside by side, as any two Uncle Franks could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am looking over \"Self-Control\" again, and my opinion is confirmed of\\r\\nits being an excellently meant, elegantly written work, without anything\\r\\nof nature or probability in it. I declare I do not know whether Laura\\'s\\r\\npassage down the American river is not the most natural, possible,\\r\\nevery-day thing she ever does.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tuesday._--Dear me! what is to become of me? Such a long letter!\\r\\nTwo-and-forty lines in the second page. Like Harriot Byron, I ask, what\\r\\nam I to do with my gratitude? I can do nothing but thank you and go on.\\r\\nA few of your inquiries, I think, are replied to _en avance_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of F. Cage\\'s drawing-master is O\\'Neil. We are exceedingly\\r\\namused with your Shalden news, and your self-reproach on the subject of\\r\\nMrs. Stockwell made me laugh heartily. I rather wondered that\\r\\nJohncock,[25] the only person in the room, could help laughing too. I had\\r\\nnot heard before of her having the measles. Mrs. H. and Alethea\\'s\\r\\nstaying till Friday was quite new to me; a good plan, however. I could\\r\\nnot have settled it better myself, and am glad they found so much in the\\r\\nhouse to approve, and I hope they will ask Martha to visit them. I\\r\\nadmire the sagacity and taste of Charlotte Williams. Those large dark\\r\\neyes always judge well. I will compliment her by naming a heroine after\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward has had all the particulars of the building, etc., read to him\\r\\ntwice over, and seems very well satisfied. A narrow door to the pantry\\r\\nis the only subject of solicitude; it is certainly just the door which\\r\\nshould not be narrow, on account of the trays; but if a case of\\r\\nnecessity, it must be borne.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew there was sugar in the tin, but had no idea of there being enough\\r\\nto last through your company. All the better. You ought not to think\\r\\nthis new loaf better than the other, because that was the first of five\\r\\nwhich all came together. Something of fancy, perhaps, and something of\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Mrs. Digweed! I cannot bear that she should not be foolishly happy\\r\\nafter a ball. I hope Miss Yates and her companions were all well the day\\r\\nafter their arrival. I am thoroughly rejoiced that Miss Benn has placed\\r\\nherself in lodgings, though I hope they may not be long necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo letter from Charles yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthey\\'s \"Life of Nelson.\" I am tired of \"Lives of Nelson,\" being that\\r\\nI never read any. I will read this, however, if Frank is mentioned in\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere am I in Kent, with one brother in the same county and another\\r\\nbrother\\'s wife, and see nothing of them, which seems unnatural. It will\\r\\nnot last so forever, I trust. I should like to have Mrs. F. A. and her\\r\\nchildren here for a week, but not a syllable of that nature is ever\\r\\nbreathed. I wish her last visit had not been so long a one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder whether Mrs. Tilson has ever lain-in. Mention it if it ever\\r\\ncomes to your knowledge, and we shall hear of it by the same post from\\r\\nHenry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rob. Mascall breakfasted here; he eats a great deal of butter. I\\r\\ndined upon goose yesterday, which, I hope, will secure a good sale of my\\r\\nsecond edition. Have you any tomatas? Fanny and I regale on them every\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisastrous letters from the Plumptres and Oxendens. Refusals\\r\\neverywhere--a blank _partout_--and it is not quite certain whether we go\\r\\nor not; something may depend upon the disposition of Uncle Edward when\\r\\nhe comes, and upon what we hear at Chilham Castle this morning, for we\\r\\nare going to pay visits. We are going to each house at Chilham and to\\r\\nMystole. I shall like seeing the Faggs. I shall like it all, except that\\r\\nwe are to set out so early that I have not time to write as I would\\r\\nwish.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdwd. Bridges\\'s friend is a Mr. Hawker, I find, not Harpur. I would not\\r\\nhave you sleep in such an error for the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother desires his best love and thanks for all your information. He\\r\\nhopes the roots of the old beech have been dug away enough to allow a\\r\\nproper covering of mould and turf. He is sorry for the necessity of\\r\\nbuilding the new coin, but hopes they will contrive that the doorway\\r\\nshould be of the usual width,--if it must be contracted on one side, by\\r\\nwidening it on the other. The appearance need not signify. And he\\r\\ndesires me to say that your being at Chawton when he is will be quite\\r\\nnecessary. You cannot think it more indispensable than he does. He is\\r\\nvery much obliged to you for your attention to everything. Have you any\\r\\nidea of returning with him to Henrietta Street and finishing your visit\\r\\nthen? Tell me your sweet little innocent ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything of love and kindness, proper and improper, must now suffice.\\r\\n\\r\\n                             Yours very affectionately,      J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Chawton, Alton, Hants.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[25] The butler at Godmersham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Thursday (Oct. 14).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Now I will prepare for Mr. Lushington, and as it\\r\\nwill be wisest also to prepare for his not coming, or my not getting a\\r\\nfrank, I shall write very close from the first, and even leave room for\\r\\nthe seal in the proper place. When I have followed up my last with this\\r\\nI shall feel somewhat less unworthy of you than the state of our\\r\\ncorrespondence now requires.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left off in a great hurry to prepare for our morning visits. Of course\\r\\nwas ready a good deal the first, and need not have hurried so much.\\r\\nFanny wore her new gown and cap. I was surprised to find Mystole so\\r\\npretty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies were at home. I was in luck, and saw Lady Fagg and all her\\r\\nfive daughters, with an old Mrs. Hamilton, from Canterbury, and Mrs. and\\r\\nMiss Chapman, from Margate, into the bargain. I never saw so plain a\\r\\nfamily,--five sisters so very plain! They are as plain as the Foresters,\\r\\nor the Franfraddops, or the Seagraves, or the Rivers, excluding Sophy.\\r\\nMiss Sally Fagg has a pretty figure, and that comprises all the good\\r\\nlooks of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was stupidish; Fanny did her part very well, but there was a lack of\\r\\ntalk altogether, and the three friends in the house only sat by and\\r\\nlooked at us. However, Miss Chapman\\'s name is Laura, and she had a\\r\\ndouble flounce to her gown. You really must get some flounces. Are not\\r\\nsome of your large stock of white morning gowns just in a happy state\\r\\nfor a flounce--too short? Nobody at home at either house in Chilham.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward Bridges and his friend did not forget to arrive. The friend is a\\r\\nMr. Wigram, one of the three-and-twenty children of a great rich\\r\\nmercantile, Sir Robert Wigram, an old acquaintance of the Footes, but\\r\\nvery recently known to Edward B. The history of his coming here is,\\r\\nthat, intending to go from Ramsgate to Brighton, Edw. B. persuaded him\\r\\nto take Lenham on his way, which gave him the convenience of Mr. W.\\'s\\r\\ngig, and the comfort of not being alone there; but, probably thinking a\\r\\nfew days of Gm. would be the cheapest and pleasantest way of\\r\\nentertaining his friend and himself, offered a visit here, and here they\\r\\nstay till to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. W. is about five or six-and-twenty, not ill-looking, and not\\r\\nagreeable. He is certainly no addition. A sort of cool, gentlemanlike\\r\\nmanner, but very silent. They say his name is Henry, a proof how\\r\\nunequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed. I have seen many a John and\\r\\nThomas much more agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have got rid of Mr. R. Mascall, however. I did not like him, either.\\r\\nHe talks too much, and is conceited, besides having a vulgarly shaped\\r\\nmouth. He slept here on Tuesday, so that yesterday Fanny and I sat down\\r\\nto breakfast with six gentlemen to admire us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not go to the ball. It was left to her to decide, and at last she\\r\\ndetermined against it. She knew that it would be a sacrifice on the part\\r\\nof her father and brothers if they went, and I hope it will prove that\\r\\nshe has not sacrificed much. It is not likely that there should have\\r\\nbeen anybody there whom she would care for. I was very glad to be spared\\r\\nthe trouble of dressing and going, and being weary before it was half\\r\\nover; so my gown and my cap are still unworn. It will appear at last,\\r\\nperhaps, that I might have done without either. I produced my brown\\r\\nbombazine yesterday, and it was very much admired indeed, and I like it\\r\\nbetter than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have given many particulars of the state of Chawton House, but still\\r\\nwe want more. Edward wants to be expressly told that all the round\\r\\ntower, etc., is entirely down, and the door from the best room stopped\\r\\nup; he does not know enough of the appearance of things in that quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe heard from Bath yesterday. Lady B. continues very well, and Dr.\\r\\nParry\\'s opinion is, that while the water agrees with her she ought to\\r\\nremain there, which throws their coming away at a greater uncertainty\\r\\nthan we had supposed. It will end, perhaps, in a fit of the gout, which\\r\\nmay prevent her coming away. Louisa thinks her mother\\'s being so well\\r\\nmay be quite as much owing to her being so much out of doors as to the\\r\\nwater. Lady B. is going to try the hot pump, the Cross bath being about\\r\\nto be painted. Louisa is particularly well herself, and thinks the water\\r\\nhas been of use to her. She mentioned our inquiries, etc., to Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Alex. Evelyn, and had their best compliments and thanks to give in\\r\\nreturn. Dr. Parry does not expect Mr. E. to last much longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly think of Mrs. Holder\\'s being dead! Poor woman, she has done the\\r\\nonly thing in the world she could possibly do to make one cease to abuse\\r\\nher. Now, if you please, Hooper must have it in his power to do more by\\r\\nhis uncle. Lucky for the little girl. An Anne Ekins can hardly be so\\r\\nunfit for the care of a child as a Mrs. Holder.\\r\\n\\r\\nA letter from Wrotham yesterday offering an early visit here, and Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Moore and one child are to come on Monday for ten days. I hope\\r\\nCharles and Fanny may not fix the same time, but if they come at all in\\r\\nOctober they must. What is the use of hoping? The two parties of\\r\\nchildren is the chief evil.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, here we are; the very thing has happened, or rather\\r\\nworse,--a letter from Charles this very morning, which gives us reason\\r\\nto suppose they may come here to-day. It depends upon the weather, and\\r\\nthe weather now is very fine. No difficulties are made, however, and,\\r\\nindeed, there will be no want of room; but I wish there were no Wigrams\\r\\nand Lushingtons in the way to fill up the table and make us such a\\r\\nmotley set. I cannot spare Mr. Lushington either, because of his frank,\\r\\nbut Mr. Wigram does no good to anybody. I cannot imagine how a man can\\r\\nhave the impudence to come into a family party for three days, where he\\r\\nis quite a stranger, unless he knows himself to be agreeable on\\r\\nundoubted authority. He and Edw. B. are going to ride to Eastwell, and\\r\\nas the boys are hunting, and my brother is gone to Canty., Fanny and I\\r\\nhave a quiet morning before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward has driven off poor Mrs. Salkeld. It was thought a good\\r\\nopportunity of doing something towards clearing the house. By her own\\r\\ndesire Mrs. Fanny[26] is to be put in the room next the nursery, her baby\\r\\nin a little bed by her; and as Cassy is to have the closet within, and\\r\\nBetsey William\\'s little hole, they will be all very snug together. I\\r\\nshall be most happy to see dear Charles, and he will be as happy as he\\r\\ncan with a cross child, or some such care, pressing on him at the time.\\r\\nI should be very happy in the idea of seeing little Cassy again, too,\\r\\ndid not I fear she would disappoint me by some immediate\\r\\ndisagreeableness. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comfort of the billiard-table here is very great; it draws all the\\r\\ngentlemen to it whenever they are within, especially after dinner, so\\r\\nthat my brother, Fanny, and I have the library to ourselves in\\r\\ndelightful quiet. There is no truth in the report of G. Hatton being to\\r\\nmarry Miss Wemyss. He desires it may be contradicted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you done anything about our present to Miss Benn? I suppose she\\r\\nmust have a bed at my mother\\'s whenever she dines there. How will they\\r\\nmanage as to inviting her when you are gone? and if they invite, how\\r\\nwill they continue to entertain her?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me know as many of your parting arrangements as you can, as to wine,\\r\\netc. I wonder whether the ink-bottle has been filled. Does butcher\\'s\\r\\nmeat keep up at the same price, and is not bread lower than 2_s._ 6_d._?\\r\\nMary\\'s blue gown! My mother must be in agonies. I have a great mind to\\r\\nhave my blue gown dyed some time or other. I proposed it once to you,\\r\\nand you made some objection, I forget what. It is the fashion of\\r\\nflounces that gives it particular expediency.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. and Miss Wildman have just been here. Miss is very plain. I wish\\r\\nLady B. may be returned before we leave Gm., that Fanny may spend the\\r\\ntime of her father\\'s absence at Goodnestone, which is what she would\\r\\nprefer.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friday._--They came last night at about seven. We had given them up,\\r\\nbut I still expected them to come. Dessert was nearly over; a better\\r\\ntime for arriving than an hour and a half earlier. They were late\\r\\nbecause they did not set out earlier, and did not allow time enough.\\r\\nCharles did not aim at more than reaching Sittingbourne by three, which\\r\\ncould not have brought them here by dinner-time. They had a very rough\\r\\npassage; he would not have ventured if he had known how bad it would be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, here they are, safe and well, just like their own nice selves,\\r\\nFanny looking as neat and white this morning as possible, and dear\\r\\nCharles all affectionate, placid, quiet, cheerful good-humor. They are\\r\\nboth looking very well, but poor little Cassy is grown extremely thin,\\r\\nand looks poorly. I hope a week\\'s country air and exercise may do her\\r\\ngood. I am sorry to say it can be but a week. The baby does not appear\\r\\nso large in proportion as she was, nor quite so pretty, but I have seen\\r\\nvery little of her. Cassy was too tired and bewildered just at first to\\r\\nseem to know anybody. We met them in the hall--the women and girl part\\r\\nof us--but before we reached the library she kissed me very\\r\\naffectionately, and has since seemed to recollect me in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite an evening of confusion, as you may suppose. At first we\\r\\nwere all walking about from one part of the house to the other; then\\r\\ncame a fresh dinner in the breakfast-room for Charles and his wife,\\r\\nwhich Fanny and I attended; then we moved into the library, were joined\\r\\nby the dining-room people, were introduced, and so forth; and then we\\r\\nhad tea and coffee, which was not over till past ten. Billiards again\\r\\ndrew all the odd ones away; and Edward, Charles, the two Fannies, and I\\r\\nsat snugly talking. I shall be glad to have our numbers a little\\r\\nreduced, and by the time you receive this we shall be only a family,\\r\\nthough a large family, party. Mr. Lushington goes to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I must speak of him, and I like him very much. I am sure he is\\r\\nclever, and a man of taste. He got a volume of Milton last night, and\\r\\nspoke of it with warmth. He is quite an M. P., very smiling, with an\\r\\nexceeding good address and readiness of language. I am rather in love\\r\\nwith him. I dare say he is ambitious and insincere. He puts me in mind\\r\\nof Mr. Dundas. He has a wide smiling mouth, and very good teeth, and\\r\\nsomething the same complexion and nose. He is a much shorter man, with\\r\\nMartha\\'s leave. Does Martha never hear from Mrs. Craven? Is Mrs. Craven\\r\\nnever at home?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe breakfasted in the dining-room to-day, and are now all pretty well\\r\\ndispersed and quiet. Charles and George are gone out shooting together,\\r\\nto Winnigates and Seaton Wood. I asked on purpose to tell Henry. Mr.\\r\\nLushington and Edwd. are gone some other way. I wish Charles may kill\\r\\nsomething; but this high wind is against their sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Williams is living at the Rose at Sittingbourne; they called upon\\r\\nher yesterday; she cannot live at Sheerness, and as soon as she gets to\\r\\nSittingbourne is quite well. In return for all your matches, I announce\\r\\nthat her brother William is going to marry a Miss Austen, of a Wiltshire\\r\\nfamily, who say they are related to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI talk to Cassy about Chawton; she remembers much, but does not\\r\\nvolunteer on the subject. Poor little love! I wish she were not so very\\r\\nPalmery, but it seems stronger than ever. I never knew a wife\\'s family\\r\\nfeatures have such undue influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nPapa and mamma have not yet made up their mind as to parting with her or\\r\\nnot; the chief, indeed the only, difficulty with mamma is a very\\r\\nreasonable one, the child\\'s being very unwilling to leave them. When it\\r\\nwas mentioned to her she did not like the idea of it at all. At the same\\r\\ntime she has been suffering so much lately from sea-sickness that her\\r\\nmamma cannot bear to have her much on board this winter. Charles is\\r\\nless inclined to part with her. I do not know how it will end, or what\\r\\nis to determine it. He desires his best love to you, and has not written\\r\\nbecause he has not been able to decide. They are both very sensible of\\r\\nyour kindness on the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have made Charles furnish me with something to say about young\\r\\nKendall. He is going on very well. When he first joined the \"Namur,\" my\\r\\nbrother did not find him forward enough to be what they call put in the\\r\\noffice, and therefore placed him under the schoolmaster; but he is very\\r\\nmuch improved, and goes into the office now every afternoon, still\\r\\nattending school in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cold weather comes very fortunately for Edward\\'s nerves, with such\\r\\na house full; it suits him exactly; he is all alive and cheerful. Poor\\r\\nJames, on the contrary, must be running his toes into the fire. I find\\r\\nthat Mary Jane Fowle was very near returning with her brother and paying\\r\\nthem a visit on board. I forget exactly what hindered her; I believe the\\r\\nCheltenham scheme. I am glad something did. They are to go to Cheltenham\\r\\non Monday se\\'nnight. I don\\'t vouch for their going, you know; it only\\r\\ncomes from one of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I think I have written you a good-sized letter, and may deserve\\r\\nwhatever I can get in reply. Infinities of love. I must distinguish\\r\\nthat of Fanny, senior, who particularly desires to be remembered to you\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                          J.

We are all very glad to hear\\r\\nthat the Adams are gone, and hope Dame Libscombe will be more happy now\\r\\nwith her deaffy child, as she calls it, but I am afraid there is not\\r\\nmuch chance of her remaining long sole mistress of her house.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sorry you had not any better news to send us of our hare, poor\\r\\nlittle thing! I thought it would not live long in that _Pondy House_; I\\r\\ndon\\'t wonder that Mary Doe is very sorry it is dead, because we promised\\r\\nher that if it was alive when we came back to Chawton, we would reward\\r\\nher for her trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nPapa is much obliged to you for ordering the scrubby firs to be cut\\r\\ndown; I think he was rather frightened at first about the great oak.\\r\\nFanny quite believed it, for she exclaimed, \"Dear me, what a pity, how\\r\\ncould they be so stupid!\" I hope by this time they have put up some\\r\\nhurdles for the sheep, or turned out the cart-horses from the lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nPray tell grandmamma that we have begun getting seeds for her; I hope we\\r\\nshall be able to get her a nice collection, but I am afraid this wet\\r\\nweather is very much against them. How glad I am to hear she has had\\r\\nsuch good success with her chickens, but I wish there had been more\\r\\nbantams amongst them. I am very sorry to hear of poor Lizzie\\'s fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must now tell you something about our poor people. I believe you know\\r\\nold Mary Croucher; she gets _maderer_ and _maderer_ every day. Aunt Jane\\r\\nhas been to see her, but it was on one of her rational days. Poor Will\\r\\nAmos hopes your skewers are doing well; he has left his house in the\\r\\npoor Row, and lives in a barn at Builting. We asked him why he went\\r\\naway, and he said the fleas were so starved when he came back from\\r\\nChawton that they all flew upon him and _eenermost_ eat him up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow unlucky it is that the weather is so wet! Poor Uncle Charles has\\r\\ncome home half drowned every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t think little Fanny is quite so pretty as she was; one reason is\\r\\nbecause she wears short petticoats, I believe. I hope Cook is better;\\r\\nshe was very unwell the day we went away. Papa has given me\\r\\nhalf-a-dozen new pencils, which are very good ones indeed; I draw every\\r\\nother day. I hope you go and whip Lucy Chalcraft every night.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Clewes begs me to give her very best respects to you; she is very\\r\\nmuch obliged to you for your kind inquiries after her. Pray give my duty\\r\\nto grandmamma and love to Miss Floyd. I remain, my dear Aunt Cassandra,\\r\\nyour very affectionate niece,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               ELIZTH. KNIGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Thursday._--I think Lizzy\\'s letter will entertain you. Thank you for\\r\\nyours just received. To-morrow shall be fine if possible. You will be at\\r\\nGuildford before our party set off. They only go to Key Street, as Mr.\\r\\nStreet the Purser lives there, and they have promised to dine and sleep\\r\\nwith him.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassy\\'s looks are much mended. She agrees pretty well with her cousins,\\r\\nbut is not quite happy among them; they are too many and too boisterous\\r\\nfor her. I have given her your message, but she said nothing, and did\\r\\nnot look as if the idea of going to Chawton again was a pleasant one.\\r\\nThey have Edward\\'s carriage to Ospringe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I have just done a good deed,--extracted Charles from his wife\\r\\nand children upstairs, and made him get ready to go out shooting, and\\r\\nnot keep Mr. Moore waiting any longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Sherer and Joseph dined here yesterday very prettily. Edw.\\r\\nand Geo. were absent,--gone for a night to Eastling. The two Fannies\\r\\nwent to Canty. in the morning, and took Lou. and Cass. to try on new\\r\\nstays. Harriet and I had a comfortable walk together. She desires her\\r\\nbest love to you and kind remembrance to Henry. Fanny\\'s best love also.\\r\\nI fancy there is to be another party to Canty. to-morrow,--Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nMoore and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward thanks Henry for his letter. We are most happy to hear he is so\\r\\nmuch better. I depend upon you for letting me know what he wishes as to\\r\\nmy staying with him or not; you will be able to find out, I dare say. I\\r\\nhad intended to beg you would bring one of my nightcaps with you, in\\r\\ncase of my staying, but forgot it when I wrote on Tuesday. Edward is\\r\\nmuch concerned about his pond; he cannot now doubt the fact of its\\r\\nrunning out, which he was resolved to do as long as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose my mother will like to have me write to her. I shall try at\\r\\nleast.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo; I have never seen the death of Mrs. Crabbe. I have only just been\\r\\nmaking out from one of his prefaces that he probably was married. It is\\r\\nalmost ridiculous. Poor woman! I will comfort him as well as I can, but\\r\\nI do not undertake to be good to her children. She had better not leave\\r\\nany.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdw. and Geo. set off this day week for Oxford. Our party will then be\\r\\nvery small, as the Moores will be going about the same time. To enliven\\r\\nus, Fanny proposes spending a few days soon afterwards at Fredville. It\\r\\nwill really be a good opportunity, as her father will have a companion.\\r\\nWe shall all three go to Wrotham, but Edwd. and I stay only a night\\r\\nperhaps. Love to Mr. Tilson.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,     J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    10 Henrietta St., Covent Garden, London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Wednesday (Nov. 3).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I will keep this celebrated birthday by writing\\r\\nto you; and as my pen seems inclined to write large, I will put my lines\\r\\nvery close together. I had but just time to enjoy your letter yesterday\\r\\nbefore Edward and I set off in the chair for Canty., and I allowed him\\r\\nto hear the chief of it as we went along.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe rejoice sincerely in Henry\\'s gaining ground as he does, and hope\\r\\nthere will be weather for him to get out every day this week, as the\\r\\nlikeliest way of making him equal to what he plans for the next. If he\\r\\nis tolerably well, the going into Oxfordshire will make him better, by\\r\\nmaking him happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan it be that I have not given you the minuti\\xc3\\xa6 of Edward\\'s plans? See,\\r\\nhere they are: To go to Wrotham on Saturday the 13th, spend Sunday\\r\\nthere, and be in town on Monday to dinner, and if agreeable to Henry,\\r\\nspend one whole day with him, which day is likely to be Tuesday, and so\\r\\ngo down to Chawton on Wednesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now I cannot be quite easy without staying a little while with\\r\\nHenry, unless he wishes it otherwise; his illness and the dull time of\\r\\nyear together make me feel that it would be horrible of me not to offer\\r\\nto remain with him, and therefore unless you know of any objection, I\\r\\nwish you would tell him with my best love that I shall be most happy to\\r\\nspend ten days or a fortnight in Henrietta St., if he will accept me. I\\r\\ndo not offer more than a fortnight, because I shall then have been some\\r\\ntime from home; but it will be a great pleasure to be with him, as it\\r\\nalways is. I have the less regret and scruple on your account, because I\\r\\nshall see you for a day and a half, and because you will have Edward for\\r\\nat least a week. My scheme is to take Bookham in my way home for a few\\r\\ndays, and my hope that Henry will be so good as to send me some part of\\r\\nthe way thither. I have a most kind repetition of Mrs. Cooke\\'s two or\\r\\nthree dozen invitations, with the offer of meeting me anywhere in one of\\r\\nher airings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny\\'s cold is much better. By dosing and keeping her room on Sunday,\\r\\nshe got rid of the worst of it, but I am rather afraid of what this day\\r\\nmay do for her; she is gone to Canty. with Miss Clewes, Liz., and\\r\\nMa^{rnne}, and it is but roughish weather for any one in a tender state.\\r\\nMiss Clewes has been going to Canty. ever since her return, and it is\\r\\nnow just accomplishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward and I had a delightful morning for our drive there, I enjoyed it\\r\\nthoroughly; but the day turned off before we were ready, and we came\\r\\nhome in some rain and the apprehension of a great deal. It has not done\\r\\nus any harm, however. He went to inspect the gaol, as a visiting\\r\\nmagistrate, and took me with him. I was gratified, and went through all\\r\\nthe feelings which people must go through, I think, in visiting such a\\r\\nbuilding. We paid no other visits, only walked about snugly together,\\r\\nand shopped. I bought a concert ticket and a sprig of flowers for my old\\r\\nage.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo vary the subject from gay to grave with inimitable address, I shall\\r\\nnow tell you something of the Bath party--and still a Bath party they\\r\\nare, for a fit of the gout came on last week. The accounts of Lady B.\\r\\nare as good as can be under such a circumstance; Dr. P. says it appears\\r\\na good sort of gout, and her spirits are better than usual, but as to\\r\\nher coming away, it is of course all uncertainty. I have very little\\r\\ndoubt of Edward\\'s going down to Bath, if they have not left it when he\\r\\nis in Hampshire; if he does, he will go on from Steventon, and then\\r\\nreturn direct to London, without coming back to Chawton. This detention\\r\\ndoes not suit his feelings. It may be rather a good thing, however, that\\r\\nDr. P. should see Lady B. with the gout on her. Harriot was quite\\r\\nwishing for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day seems to improve. I wish my pen would too.\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet Mr. Ogle! I dare say he sees all the panoramas for nothing, has\\r\\nfree admittance everywhere; he is so delightful! Now, you need not see\\r\\nanybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to hear of our being likely to have a peep at Charles and\\r\\nFanny at Christmas, but do not force poor Cass. to stay if she hates it.\\r\\nYou have done very right as to Mrs. F. A. Your tidings of S. and S. give\\r\\nme pleasure. I have never seen it advertised.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriot, in a letter to Fanny to-day, inquires whether they sell cloths\\r\\nfor pelisses at Bedford House, and, if they do, will be very much\\r\\nobliged to you to desire them to send her down patterns, with the width\\r\\nand prices; they may go from Charing Cross almost any day in the week,\\r\\nbut if it is a ready-money house it will not do, for the _bru_ of _feu_\\r\\nthe Archbishop says she cannot pay for it immediately. Fanny and I\\r\\nsuspect they do not deal in the article.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sherers, I believe, are now really going to go; Joseph has had a bed\\r\\nhere the last two nights, and I do not know whether this is not the day\\r\\nof moving. Mrs. Sherer called yesterday to take leave. The weather looks\\r\\nworse again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dine at Chilham Castle to-morrow, and I expect to find some\\r\\namusement, but more from the concert the next day, as I am sure of\\r\\nseeing several that I want to see. We are to meet a party from\\r\\nGoodnestone, Lady B., Miss Hawley, and Lucy Foote, and I am to meet Mrs.\\r\\nHarrison, and we are to talk about Ben and Anna. \"My dear Mrs.\\r\\nHarrison,\" I shall say, \"I am afraid the young man has some of your\\r\\nfamily madness; and though there often appears to be something of\\r\\nmadness in Anna too, I think she inherits more of it from her mother\\'s\\r\\nfamily than from ours.\" That is what I shall say, and I think she will\\r\\nfind it difficult to answer me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took up your letter again to refresh me, being somewhat tired, and was\\r\\nstruck with the prettiness of the hand: it is really a very pretty hand\\r\\nnow and then,--so small and so neat! I wish I could get as much into a\\r\\nsheet of paper.[27] Another time I will take two days to make a letter\\r\\nin: it is fatiguing to write a whole long one at once. I hope to hear\\r\\nfrom you again on Sunday and again on Friday, the day before we move.\\r\\nOn Monday, I suppose, you will be going to Streatham, to see quiet Mr.\\r\\nHill and eat very bad baker\\'s bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fall in bread by the by. I hope my mother\\'s bill next week will show\\r\\nit. I have had a very comfortable letter from her, one of her foolscap\\r\\nsheets quite full of little home news. Anna was there the first of the\\r\\ntwo days. An Anna sent away and an Anna fetched are different things.\\r\\nThis will be an excellent time for Ben to pay his visit, now that we,\\r\\nthe formidables, are absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not mean to eat, but Mr. Johncock has brought in the tray, so I\\r\\nmust. I am all alone. Edward is gone into his woods. At this present\\r\\ntime I have five tables, eight-and-twenty chairs, and two fires all to\\r\\nmyself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Clewes is to be invited to go to the concert with us; there will be\\r\\nmy brother\\'s place and ticket for her, as he cannot go. He and the other\\r\\nconnections of the Cages are to meet at Milgate that very day, to\\r\\nconsult about a proposed alteration of the Maidstone road, in which the\\r\\nCages are very much interested. Sir Brook comes here in the morning, and\\r\\nthey are to be joined by Mr. Deedes at Ashford. The loss of the concert\\r\\nwill be no great evil to the Squire. We shall be a party of three ladies\\r\\ntherefore, and to meet three ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a convenient carriage Henry\\'s is, to his friends in general! Who\\r\\nhas it next? I am glad William\\'s going is voluntary, and on no worse\\r\\ngrounds. An inclination for the country is a venial fault. He has more\\r\\nof Cowper than of Johnson in him,--fonder of tame hares and blank verse\\r\\nthan of the full tide of human existence at Charing Cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! I have more of such sweet flattery from Miss Sharp. She is an\\r\\nexcellent kind friend. I am read and admired in Ireland too. There is a\\r\\nMrs. Fletcher, the wife of a judge, an old lady, and very good and very\\r\\nclever, who is all curiosity to know about me,--what I am like, and so\\r\\nforth. I am not known to her by name, however. This comes through Mrs.\\r\\nCarrick, not through Mrs. Gore. You are quite out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not despair of having my picture in the Exhibition at last,--all\\r\\nwhite and red, with my head on one side; or perhaps I may marry young\\r\\nMr. D\\'Arblay. I suppose in the mean time I shall owe dear Henry a great\\r\\ndeal of money for printing, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope Mrs. Fletcher will indulge herself with S. and S. If I am to stay\\r\\nin H. S., and if you should be writing home soon, I wish you would be so\\r\\ngood as to give a hint of it, for I am not likely to write there again\\r\\nthese ten days, having written yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny has set her heart upon its being a Mr. Brett who is going to marry\\r\\na Miss Dora Best, of this country. I dare say Henry has no objection.\\r\\nPray, where did the boys sleep?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deedes come here on Monday to stay till Friday, so that we shall end\\r\\nwith a flourish the last canto. They bring Isabella and one of the\\r\\ngrown-ups, and will come in for a Canty. ball on Thursday. I shall be\\r\\nglad to see them. Mrs. Deedes and I must talk rationally together, I\\r\\nsuppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward does not write to Henry, because of my writing so often. God\\r\\nbless you. I shall be so glad to see you again, and I wish you many\\r\\nhappy returns of this day. Poor Lord Howard! How he does cry about it!\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      Yours very truly,        J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    10 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[27] I cannot pass this paragraph over without remarking that it is\\r\\nhardly possible to imagine anything neater or prettier than Jane\\'s own\\r\\nhand. Most of her letters are beautifully written, and the MS. of her\\r\\n\"Lady Susan\" remarkably so.--_Note by Lord_ BRABOURNE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Saturday (Nov. 6).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Having half an hour before breakfast (very snug,\\r\\nin my own room, lovely morning, excellent fire--fancy me!) I will give\\r\\nyou some account of the last two days. And yet, what is there to be\\r\\ntold? I shall get foolishly minute unless I cut the matter short.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met only the Bretons at Chilham Castle, besides a Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nOsborne and a Miss Lee staying in the house, and were only fourteen\\r\\naltogether. My brother and Fanny thought it the pleasantest party they\\r\\nhad ever known there, and I was very well entertained by bits and\\r\\nscraps. I had long wanted to see Dr. Breton, and his wife amuses me very\\r\\nmuch with her affected refinement and elegance. Miss Lee I found very\\r\\nconversable; she admires Crabbe as she ought. She is at an age of\\r\\nreason, ten years older than myself at least. She was at the famous ball\\r\\nat Chilham Castle, so of course you remember her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the by, as I must leave off being young, I find many _douceurs_ in\\r\\nbeing a sort of _chaperon_, for I am put on the sofa near the fire, and\\r\\ncan drink as much wine as I like. We had music in the evening: Fanny and\\r\\nMiss Wildman played, and Mr. James Wildman sat close by and listened, or\\r\\npretended to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday was a day of dissipation all through: first came Sir Brook to\\r\\ndissipate us before breakfast; then there was a call from Mr. Sherer,\\r\\nthen a regular morning visit from Lady Honeywood in her way home from\\r\\nEastwell; then Sir Brook and Edward set off; then we dined (five in\\r\\nnumber) at half-past four; then we had coffee; and at six Miss Clewes,\\r\\nFanny, and I drove away. We had a beautiful night for our frisks. We\\r\\nwere earlier than we need have been, but after a time Lady B. and her\\r\\ntwo companions appeared,--we had kept places for them; and there we sat,\\r\\nall six in a row, under a side wall, I between Lucy Foote and Miss\\r\\nClewes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady B. was much what I expected; I could not determine whether she was\\r\\nrather handsome or very plain. I liked her for being in a hurry to have\\r\\nthe concert over and get away, and for getting away at last with a great\\r\\ndeal of decision and promptness, not waiting to compliment and dawdle\\r\\nand fuss about seeing dear Fanny, who was half the evening in another\\r\\npart of the room with her friends the Plumptres. I am growing too\\r\\nminute, so I will go to breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the concert was over, Mrs. Harrison and I found each other out, and\\r\\nhad a very comfortable little complimentary friendly chat. She is a\\r\\nsweet woman,--still quite a sweet woman in herself, and so like her\\r\\nsister! I could almost have thought I was speaking to Mrs. Lefroy. She\\r\\nintroduced me to her daughter, whom I think pretty, but most dutifully\\r\\ninferior to _la M\\xc3\\xa8re Beaut\\xc3\\xa9_. The Faggs and the Hammonds were\\r\\nthere,--Wm. Hammond the only young man of renown. Miss looked very\\r\\nhandsome, but I prefer her little smiling flirting sister Julia.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was just introduced at last to Mary Plumptre, but I should hardly know\\r\\nher again. She was delighted with me, however, good enthusiastic soul!\\r\\nAnd Lady B. found me handsomer than she expected, so you see I am not so\\r\\nvery bad as you might think for.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was twelve before we reached home. We were all dog-tired, but pretty\\r\\nwell to-day: Miss Clewes says she has not caught cold, and Fanny\\'s does\\r\\nnot seem worse. I was so tired that I began to wonder how I should get\\r\\nthrough the ball next Thursday; but there will be so much more variety\\r\\nthen in walking about, and probably so much less heat, that perhaps I\\r\\nmay not feel it more. My china crape is still kept for the ball. Enough\\r\\nof the concert.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a letter from Mary yesterday. They travelled down to Cheltenham\\r\\nlast Monday very safely, and are certainly to be there a month. Bath is\\r\\nstill Bath. The H. Bridges must quit them early next week, and Louisa\\r\\nseems not quite to despair of their all moving together, but to those\\r\\nwho see at a distance there appears no chance of it. Dr. Parry does not\\r\\nwant to keep Lady B. at Bath when she can once move. That is lucky. You\\r\\nwill see poor Mr. Evelyn\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I wrote last, my 2nd edit. has stared me in the face. Mary tells\\r\\nme that Eliza means to buy it. I wish she may. It can hardly depend upon\\r\\nany more Fyfield Estates. I cannot help hoping that many will feel\\r\\nthemselves obliged to buy it. I shall not mind imagining it a\\r\\ndisagreeable duty to them, so as they do it. Mary heard before she left\\r\\nhome that it was very much admired at Cheltenham, and that it was given\\r\\nto Miss Hamilton. It is pleasant to have such a respectable writer\\r\\nnamed. I cannot tire you, I am sure, on this subject, or I would\\r\\napologize.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat weather, and what news! We have enough to do to admire them both. I\\r\\nhope you derive your full share of enjoyment from each.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have extended my lights and increased my acquaintance a good deal\\r\\nwithin these two days. Lady Honeywood you know; I did not sit near\\r\\nenough to be a perfect judge, but I thought her extremely pretty, and\\r\\nher manners have all the recommendations of ease and good-humor and\\r\\nunaffectedness; and going about with four horses and nicely dressed\\r\\nherself, she is altogether a perfect sort of woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, and I saw Mr. Gipps last night,--the useful Mr. Gipps, whose\\r\\nattentions came in as acceptably to us in handing us to the carriage,\\r\\nfor want of a better man, as they did to Emma Plumptre. I thought him\\r\\nrather a good-looking little man.\\r\\n\\r\\nI long for your letter to-morrow, particularly that I may know my fate\\r\\nas to London. My first wish is that Henry should really choose what he\\r\\nlikes best; I shall certainly not be sorry if he does not want me.\\r\\nMorning church to-morrow; I shall come back with impatient feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sherers are gone, but the Pagets are not come: we shall therefore\\r\\nhave Mr. S. again. Mr. Paget acts like an unsteady man. Dr. Hant,\\r\\nhowever, gives him a very good character; what is wrong is to be imputed\\r\\nto the lady. I dare say the house likes female government.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a nice long black and red letter from Charles, but not\\r\\ncommunicating much that I did not know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some chance of a good ball next week, as far as females go.\\r\\nLady Bridges may perhaps be there with some Knatchbulls. Mrs. Harrison\\r\\nperhaps, with Miss Oxenden and the Miss Papillons; and if Mrs. Harrison,\\r\\nthen Lady Fagg will come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shades of evening are descending, and I resume my interesting\\r\\nnarrative. Sir Brook and my brother came back about four, and Sir Brook\\r\\nalmost immediately set forward again to Goodnestone. We are to have\\r\\nEdwd. B. to-morrow, to pay us another Sunday\\'s visit,--the last, for\\r\\nmore reasons than one; they all come home on the same day that we go.\\r\\nThe Deedes do not come till Tuesday; Sophia is to be the comer. She is a\\r\\ndisputable beauty that I want much to see. Lady Eliz. Hatton and\\r\\nAnnamaria called here this morning. Yes, they called; but I do not think\\r\\nI can say anything more about them. They came, and they sat, and they\\r\\nwent.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sunday._--Dearest Henry! What a turn he has for being ill, and what a\\r\\nthing bile is! This attack has probably been brought on in part by his\\r\\nprevious confinement and anxiety; but, however it came, I hope it is\\r\\ngoing fast, and that you will be able to send a very good account of him\\r\\non Tuesday. As I hear on Wednesday, of course I shall not expect to hear\\r\\nagain on Friday. Perhaps a letter to Wrotham would not have an ill\\r\\neffect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are to be off on Saturday before the post comes in, as Edward takes\\r\\nhis own horses all the way. He talks of nine o\\'clock. We shall bait at\\r\\nLenham.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcellent sweetness of you to send me such a nice long letter; it made\\r\\nits appearance, with one from my mother, soon after I and my impatient\\r\\nfeelings walked in. How glad I am that I did what I did! I was only\\r\\nafraid that you might think the offer superfluous, but you have set my\\r\\nheart at ease. Tell Henry that I will stay with him, let it be ever so\\r\\ndisagreeable to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, dear me! I have not time on paper for half that I want to say. There\\r\\nhave been two letters from Oxford,--one from George yesterday. They got\\r\\nthere very safely,--Edwd. two hours behind the coach, having lost his\\r\\nway in leaving London. George writes cheerfully and quietly; hopes to\\r\\nhave Utterson\\'s rooms soon; went to lecture on Wednesday, states some of\\r\\nhis expenses, and concludes with saying, \"I am afraid I shall be poor.\"\\r\\nI am glad he thinks about it so soon. I believe there is no private\\r\\ntutor yet chosen, but my brother is to hear from Edwd. on the subject\\r\\nshortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou, and Mrs. H., and Catherine, and Alethea going about together in\\r\\nHenry\\'s carriage seeing sights--I am not used to the idea of it yet. All\\r\\nthat you are to see of Streatham, seen already! Your Streatham and my\\r\\nBookham may go hang. The prospect of being taken down to Chawton by\\r\\nHenry perfects the plan to me. I was in hopes of your seeing some\\r\\nilluminations, and you have seen them. \"I thought you would come, and\\r\\nyou did come.\" I am sorry he is not to come from the Baltic sooner. Poor\\r\\nMary!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother has a letter from Louisa to-day of an unwelcome nature; they\\r\\nare to spend the winter at Bath. It was just decided on. Dr. Parry\\r\\nwished it, not from thinking the water necessary to Lady B., but that he\\r\\nmight be better able to judge how far his treatment of her, which is\\r\\ntotally different from anything she had been used to, is right; and I\\r\\nsuppose he will not mind having a few more of her Ladyship\\'s guineas.\\r\\nHis system is a lowering one. He took twelve ounces of blood from her\\r\\nwhen the gout appeared, and forbids wine, etc. Hitherto the plan agrees\\r\\nwith her. She is very well satisfied to stay, but it is a sore\\r\\ndisappointment to Louisa and Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe H. Bridges leave them on Tuesday, and they mean to move into a\\r\\nsmaller house; you may guess how Edward feels. There can be no doubt of\\r\\nhis going to Bath now; I should not wonder if he brought Fanny Cage back\\r\\nwith him.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall hear from me once more, some day or other.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not like Mr. Hampson\\'s scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    10 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                            HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (March 2, 1814).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had altogether a very good journey, and everything at Cobham was\\r\\ncomfortable. I could not pay Mr. Harrington! That was the only alas! of\\r\\nthe business. I shall therefore return his bill, and my mother\\'s 2_l._,\\r\\nthat you may try your luck. We did not begin reading till Bentley Green.\\r\\nHenry\\'s approbation is hitherto even equal to my wishes. He says it is\\r\\ndifferent from the other two, but does not appear to think it at all\\r\\ninferior. He has only married Mrs. R.[28] I am afraid he has gone through\\r\\nthe most entertaining part. He took to Lady B. and Mrs. N.[29] most\\r\\nkindly, and gives great praise to the drawing of the characters. He\\r\\nunderstands them all, likes Fanny, and, I think, foresees how it will\\r\\nall be. I finished the \"Heroine\" last night, and was very much amused by\\r\\nit. I wonder James did not like it better. It diverted me exceedingly.\\r\\nWe went to bed at ten. I was very tired, but slept to a miracle, and am\\r\\nlovely to-day, and at present Henry seems to have no complaint. We left\\r\\nCobham at half-past eight, stopped to bait and breakfast at Kingston,\\r\\nand were in this house considerably before two. Nice smiling Mr. Barlowe\\r\\nmet us at the door, and, in reply to inquiries after news, said that\\r\\npeace was generally expected. I have taken possession of my bedroom,\\r\\nunpacked my bandbox, sent Miss P.\\'s two letters to the twopenny post,\\r\\nbeen visited by M^{d.} B., and am now writing by myself at the new table\\r\\nin the front room. It is snowing. We had some snowstorms yesterday, and\\r\\na smart frost at night, which gave us a hard road from Cobham to\\r\\nKingston; but as it was then getting dirty and heavy, Henry had a pair\\r\\nof leaders put on to the bottom of Sloane St. His own horses, therefore,\\r\\ncannot have had hard work. I watched for veils as we drove through the\\r\\nstreets, and had the pleasure of seeing several upon vulgar heads. And\\r\\nnow, how do you all do?--you in particular, after the worry of yesterday\\r\\nand the day before. I hope Martha had a pleasant visit again, and that\\r\\nyou and my mother could eat your beef-pudding. Depend upon my thinking\\r\\nof the chimney-sweeper as soon as I wake to-morrow. Places are secured\\r\\nat Drury Lane for Saturday, but so great is the rage for seeing Kean\\r\\nthat only a third and fourth row could be got; as it is in a front box,\\r\\nhowever, I hope we shall do pretty well--Shylock, a good play for\\r\\nFanny--she cannot be much affected, I think. Mrs. Perigord has just been\\r\\nhere. She tells me that we owe her master for the silk-dyeing. My poor\\r\\nold muslin has never been dyed yet. It has been promised to be done\\r\\nseveral times. What wicked people dyers are! They begin with dipping\\r\\ntheir own souls in scarlet sin. It is evening. We have drank tea, and I\\r\\nhave torn through the third vol. of the \"Heroine.\" I do not think it\\r\\nfalls off. It is a delightful burlesque, particularly on the Radcliffe\\r\\nstyle. Henry is going on with \"Mansfield Park.\" He admires H. Crawford:\\r\\nI mean properly, as a clever, pleasant man. I tell you all the good I\\r\\ncan, as I know how much you will enjoy it. We hear that Mr. Kean is more\\r\\nadmired than ever. There are no good places to be got in Drury Lane for\\r\\nthe next fortnight, but Henry means to secure some for Saturday\\r\\nfortnight, when you are reckoned upon. Give my love to little Cass. I\\r\\nhope she found my bed comfortable last night. I have seen nobody in\\r\\nLondon yet with such a long chin as Dr. Syntax, nor anybody quite so\\r\\nlarge as Gogmagolicus.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Yours aff^{ly},       J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[28] Mrs. Rushworth in \"Mansfield Park.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[29] Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (March 9).\\r\\n\\r\\nWELL, we went to the play again last night, and as we were out a great\\r\\npart of the morning too, shopping, and seeing the Indian jugglers, I am\\r\\nvery glad to be quiet now till dressing-time. We are to dine at the\\r\\nTilsons\\', and to-morrow at Mr. Spencer\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not done breakfast yesterday when Mr. J. Plumptre appeared to say\\r\\nthat he had secured a box. Henry asked him to dine here, which I fancy\\r\\nhe was very happy to do, and so at five o\\'clock we four sat down to\\r\\ntable together, while the master of the house was preparing for going\\r\\nout himself. The \"Farmer\\'s Wife\" is a musical thing in three acts, and\\r\\nas Edward was steady in not staying for anything more, we were at home\\r\\nbefore ten.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny and Mr. J. P. are delighted with Miss S., and her merit in singing\\r\\nis, I dare say, very great; that she gave me no pleasure is no\\r\\nreflection upon her, nor, I hope, upon myself, being what Nature made me\\r\\non that article. All that I am sensible of in Miss S. is a pleasing\\r\\nperson and no skill in acting. We had Mathews, Liston, and Emery; of\\r\\ncourse, some amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur friends were off before half-past eight this morning, and had the\\r\\nprospect of a heavy cold journey before them. I think they both liked\\r\\ntheir visit very much. I am sure Fanny did. Henry sees decided\\r\\nattachment between her and his new acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a cold, too, as well as my mother and Martha. Let it be a\\r\\ngenerous emulation between us which can get rid of it first.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wear my gauze gown to-day, long sleeves and all. I shall see how they\\r\\nsucceed, but as yet I have no reason to suppose long sleeves are\\r\\nallowable. I have lowered the bosom, especially at the corners, and\\r\\nplaited black satin ribbon round the top. Such will be my costume of\\r\\nvine-leaves and paste.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepare for a play the very first evening, I rather think Covent Garden,\\r\\nto see Young in \"Richard.\" I have answered for your little companion\\'s\\r\\nbeing conveyed to Keppel St. immediately. I have never yet been able to\\r\\nget there myself, but hope I shall soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat cruel weather this is! and here is Lord Portsmouth married, too, to\\r\\nMiss Hanson.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry has finished \"Mansfield Park,\" and his approbation has not\\r\\nlessened. He found the last half of the last volume extremely\\r\\ninteresting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose my mother recollects that she gave me no money for paying\\r\\nBrecknell and Twining, and my funds will not supply enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are home in such good time that I can finish my letter to-night,\\r\\nwhich will be better than getting up to do it to-morrow, especially as,\\r\\non account of my cold, which has been very heavy in my head this\\r\\nevening, I rather think of lying in bed later than usual. I would not\\r\\nbut be well enough to go to Hertford St. on any account.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met only Genl. Chowne to-day, who has not much to say for himself. I\\r\\nwas ready to laugh at the remembrance of Frederick, and such a different\\r\\nFrederick as we chose to fancy him to the real Christopher!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Tilson had long sleeves, too, and she assured me that they are worn\\r\\nin the evening by many. I was glad to hear this. She dines here, I\\r\\nbelieve, next Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday we are to be snug with only Mr. Barlowe and an evening of\\r\\nbusiness. I am so pleased that the mead is brewed. Love to all. I have\\r\\nwritten to Mrs. Hill, and care for nobody.\\r\\n\\r\\n                            Yours affectionately,       J.

Well, you had a good journey, I trust, and all that, and not rain\\r\\nenough to spoil your bonnet. It appeared so likely to be a wet evening\\r\\nthat I went up to the Gt. House between three and four, and dawdled away\\r\\nan hour very comfortably, though Edwd. was not very brisk. The air was\\r\\nclearer in the evening, and he was better. We all five walked together\\r\\ninto the kitchen garden and along the Gosport road, and they drank tea\\r\\nwith us.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will be glad to hear that G. Turner has another situation, something\\r\\nin the cow line, near Rumsey, and he wishes to move immediately, which\\r\\nis not likely to be inconvenient to anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new nurseryman at Alton comes this morning to value the crops in the\\r\\ngarden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only letter to-day is from Mrs. Cooke to me. They do not leave home\\r\\ntill July, and want me to come to them, according to my promise. And,\\r\\nafter considering everything, I have resolved on going. My companions\\r\\npromote it. I will not go, however, till after Edward is gone, that he\\r\\nmay feel he has a somebody to give memorandums to, to the last. I must\\r\\ngive up all help from his carriage, of course. And, at any rate, it must\\r\\nbe such an excess of expense that I have quite made up my mind to it,\\r\\nand do not mean to care.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been thinking of Triggs and the chair, you may be sure, but I\\r\\nknow it will end in posting. They will meet me at Guildford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to their standing claims on me they admire \"Mansfield Park\"\\r\\nexceedingly. Mr. Cooke says \"it is the most sensible novel he ever\\r\\nread,\" and the manner in which I treat the clergy delights them very\\r\\nmuch. Altogether, I must go, and I want you to join me there when your\\r\\nvisit in Henrietta St. is over. Put this into your capacious head.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake care of yourself, and do not be trampled to death in running after\\r\\nthe Emperor. The report in Alton yesterday was that they would certainly\\r\\ntravel this road either to or from Portsmouth. I long to know what this\\r\\nbow of the Prince\\'s will produce.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw Mrs. Andrews yesterday. Mrs. Browning had seen her before. She is\\r\\nvery glad to send an Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Benn continues the same. Mr. Curtis, however, saw her yesterday,\\r\\nand said her hand was going on as well as possible. Accept our best\\r\\nlove.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                          J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, 10 Henrietta Street,\\r\\n    By favor of Mr. GRAY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               THURSDAY (June 23).\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAREST CASSANDRA,--I received your pretty letter while the children\\r\\nwere drinking tea with us, as Mr. Louch was so obliging as to walk over\\r\\nwith it. Your good account of everybody made us very happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard yesterday from Frank. When he began his letter he hoped to be\\r\\nhere on Monday, but before it was ended he had been told that the naval\\r\\nreview would not take place till Friday, which would probably occasion\\r\\nhim some delay, as he cannot get some necessary business of his own\\r\\nattended to while Portsmouth is in such a bustle. I hope Fanny has seen\\r\\nthe Emperor, and then I may fairly wish them all away. I go to-morrow,\\r\\nand hope for some delays and adventures.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother\\'s wood is brought in, but, by some mistake, no bavins. She\\r\\nmust therefore buy some.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry at White\\'s! Oh, what a Henry! I do not know what to wish as to\\r\\nMiss B., so I will hold my tongue and my wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSackree and the children set off yesterday, and have not been returned\\r\\nback upon us. They were all very well the evening before. We had\\r\\nhandsome presents from the Gt. House yesterday,--a ham and the four\\r\\nleeches. Sackree has left some shirts of her master\\'s at the school,\\r\\nwhich, finished or unfinished, she begs to have sent by Henry and Wm.\\r\\nMr. Hinton is expected home soon, which is a good thing for the shirts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have called upon Miss Dusantoy and Miss Papillon, and been very\\r\\npretty. Miss D. has a great idea of being Fanny Price,--she and her\\r\\nyoungest sister together, who is named Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Benn has drank tea with the Prowtings, and, I believe, comes to us\\r\\nthis evening. She has still a swelling about the forefinger and a little\\r\\ndischarge, and does not seem to be on the point of a perfect cure, but\\r\\nher spirits are good, and she will be most happy, I believe, to accept\\r\\nany invitation. The Clements are gone to Petersfield to look.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly think of the Marquis of Granby being dead. I hope, if it please\\r\\nHeaven there should be another son, they will have better sponsors and\\r\\nless parade.\\r\\n\\r\\nI certainly do not wish that Henry should think again of getting me to\\r\\ntown. I would rather return straight from Bookham; but if he really does\\r\\npropose it, I cannot say No to what will be so kindly intended. It could\\r\\nbe but for a few days, however, as my mother would be quite disappointed\\r\\nby my exceeding the fortnight which I now talk of as the outside--at\\r\\nleast, we could not both remain longer away comfortably.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle of July is Martha\\'s time, as far as she has any time. She has\\r\\nleft it to Mrs. Craven to fix the day. I wish she could get her money\\r\\npaid, for I fear her going at all depends upon that.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of Bath the Deans Dundases have taken a house at\\r\\nClifton--Richmond Terrace--and she is as glad of the change as even you\\r\\nand I should be, or almost. She will now be able to go on from Berks and\\r\\nvisit them without any fears from heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis post has brought me a letter from Miss Sharpe. Poor thing! she has\\r\\nbeen suffering indeed, but is now in a comparative state of comfort. She\\r\\nis at Sir W. P.\\'s, in Yorkshire, with the children, and there is no\\r\\nappearance of her quitting them. Of course we lose the pleasure of\\r\\nseeing her here. She writes highly of Sir Wm. I do so want him to marry\\r\\nher. There is a Dow. Lady P. presiding there to make it all right. The\\r\\nMan is the same; but she does not mention what he is by profession or\\r\\ntrade. She does not think Lady P. was privy to his scheme on her, but,\\r\\non being in his power, yielded. Oh, Sir Wm.! Sir Wm.! how I will love\\r\\nyou if you will love Miss Sharpe!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Driver, etc., are off by Collier, but so near being too late that\\r\\nshe had not time to call and leave the keys herself. I have them,\\r\\nhowever. I suppose one is the key of the linen-press, but I do not know\\r\\nwhat to guess the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coach was stopped at the blacksmith\\'s, and they came running down\\r\\nwith Triggs and Browning, and trunks, and birdcages. Quite amusing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother desires her love, and hopes to hear from you.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                       J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank and Mary are to have Mary Goodchild to help as _Under_ till they\\r\\ncan get a cook. She is delighted to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest love at Streatham.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Henrietta St.\\r\\n    By favor of Mr. GRAY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLVII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                        23 HANS PLACE, Tuesday morning (August, 1814).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I had a very good journey, not crowded, two of the\\r\\nthree taken up at Bentley being children, the others of a reasonable\\r\\nsize; and they were all very quiet and civil. We were late in London,\\r\\nfrom being a great load, and from changing coaches at Farnham; it was\\r\\nnearly four, I believe, when we reached Sloane Street. Henry himself met\\r\\nme, and as soon as my trunk and basket could be routed out from all the\\r\\nother trunks and baskets in the world, we were on our way to Hans Place\\r\\nin the luxury of a nice, large, cool, dirty hackney coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were four in the kitchen part of Yalden, and I was told fifteen at\\r\\ntop, among them Percy Benn. We met in the same room at Egham, but poor\\r\\nPercy was not in his usual spirits. He would be more chatty, I dare say,\\r\\nin his way from Woolwich. We took up a young Gibson at Holybourn, and,\\r\\nin short, everybody either did come up by Yalden yesterday, or wanted to\\r\\ncome up. It put me in mind of my own coach between Edinburgh and\\r\\nStirling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry is very well, and has given me an account of the Canterbury races,\\r\\nwhich seem to have been as pleasant as one could wish. Everything went\\r\\nwell. Fanny had good partners, Mr. ---- was her second on Thursday, but\\r\\nhe did not dance with her any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will content you for the present. I must just add, however, that\\r\\nthere were no Lady Charlottes, they were gone off to Kirby, and that\\r\\nMary Oxenden, instead of dying, is going to marry Wm. Hammond.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo James and Edward yet. Our evening yesterday was perfectly quiet; we\\r\\nonly talked a little to Mr. Tilson across the intermediate gardens; she\\r\\nwas gone out airing with Miss Burdett. It is a delightful place,--more\\r\\nthan answers my expectation. Having got rid of my unreasonable ideas, I\\r\\nfind more space and comfort in the rooms than I had supposed, and the\\r\\ngarden is quite a love. I am in the front attic, which is the bedchamber\\r\\nto be preferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry wants you to see it all, and asked whether you would return with\\r\\nhim from Hampshire; I encouraged him to think you would. He breakfasts\\r\\nhere early, and then rides to Henrietta St. If it continues fine, John\\r\\nis to drive me there by and by, and we shall take an airing together;\\r\\nand I do not mean to take any other exercise, for I feel a little tired\\r\\nafter my long jumble. I live in his room downstairs; it is particularly\\r\\npleasant from opening upon the garden. I go and refresh myself every now\\r\\nand then, and then come back to solitary coolness. There is one\\r\\nmaidservant only, a very creditable, clean-looking young woman. Richard\\r\\nremains for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday morning._--My brother and Edwd. arrived last night. They\\r\\ncould not get places the day before. Their business is about teeth and\\r\\nwigs, and they are going after breakfast to Scarman\\'s and Tavistock St.,\\r\\nand they are to return to go with me afterwards in the barouche. I hope\\r\\nto do some of my errands to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got the willow yesterday, as Henry was not quite ready when I reached\\r\\nHena. St. I saw Mr. Hampson there for a moment. He dines here to-morrow,\\r\\nand proposed bringing his son; so I must submit to seeing George\\r\\nHampson, though I had hoped to go through life without it. It was one of\\r\\nmy vanities, like your not reading \"Patronage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter leaving H. St. we drove to Mrs. Latouche\\'s; they are always at\\r\\nhome, and they are to dine here on Friday. We could do no more, as it\\r\\nbegan to rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dine at half-past four to-day, that our visitors may go to the play,\\r\\nand Henry and I are to spend the evening with the Tilsons, to meet Miss\\r\\nBurnett, who leaves town to-morrow. Mrs. T. called on me yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs not this all that can have happened or been arranged? Not quite.\\r\\nHenry wants me to see more of his Hanwell favorite, and has written to\\r\\ninvite her to spend a day or two here with me. His scheme is to fetch\\r\\nher on Saturday. I am more and more convinced that he will marry again\\r\\nsoon, and like the idea of her better than of anybody else at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I have breakfasted and have the room to myself again. It is likely\\r\\nto be a fine day. How do you all do?\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry talks of being at Chawton about the 1st of Sept. He has once\\r\\nmentioned a scheme which I should rather like,--calling on the Birches\\r\\nand the Crutchleys in our way. It may never come to anything, but I must\\r\\nprovide for the possibility by troubling you to send up my silk pelisse\\r\\nby Collier on Saturday. I feel it would be necessary on such an\\r\\noccasion; and be so good as to put up a clean dressing-gown which will\\r\\ncome from the wash on Friday. You need not direct it to be left\\r\\nanywhere. It may take its chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are to call for Henry between three and four, and I must finish this\\r\\nand carry it with me, as he is not always there in the morning before\\r\\nthe parcel is made up. And before I set off, I must return Mrs. Tilson\\'s\\r\\nvisit. I hear nothing of the Hoblyns, and abstain from all inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope Mary Jane and Frank\\'s gardens go on well. Give my love to them\\r\\nall--Nunna Hat\\'s love to George. A great many people wanted to run up in\\r\\nthe Poach as well as me. The wheat looked very well all the way, and\\r\\nJames says the same of _his_ road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same good account of Mrs. C.\\'s health continues, and her\\r\\ncircumstances mend. She gets farther and farther from poverty. What a\\r\\ncomfort! Good-by to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Yours very truly and affectionately,\\r\\n                                                        JANE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll well at Steventon. I hear nothing particular of Ben, except that\\r\\nEdward is to get him some pencils.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.\\r\\n    By favor of Mr. GRAY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR ANNA,[31]--I am very much obliged to you for sending your MS. It\\r\\nhas entertained me extremely; indeed all of us. I read it aloud to your\\r\\ngrandmamma and Aunt Cass, and we were all very much pleased. The spirit\\r\\ndoes not droop at all. Sir Thos., Lady Helen, and St. Julian are very\\r\\nwell done, and Cecilia continues to be interesting in spite of her being\\r\\nso amiable. It was very fit you should advance her age. I like the\\r\\nbeginning of Devereux Forester very much, a great deal better than if he\\r\\nhad been very good or very bad. A few verbal corrections are all that I\\r\\nfelt tempted to make; the principal of them is a speech of St. Julian to\\r\\nLady Helen, which you see I have presumed to alter. As Lady H. is\\r\\nCecilia\\'s superior, it would not be correct to talk of her being\\r\\nintroduced. It is Cecilia who must be introduced. And I do not like a\\r\\nlover speaking in the 3rd person; it is too much like the part of Lord\\r\\nOvertley, and I think it not natural. If you think differently, however,\\r\\nyou need not mind me. I am impatient for more, and only wait for a safe\\r\\nconveyance to return this.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                         J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[31] Miss Anna Austen, at this time engaged to Mr. Lefroy, was writing a\\r\\nnovel which she sent to her aunt for criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                   AUGUST 10, 1814.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR ANNA,--I am quite ashamed to find that I have never answered\\r\\nsome question of yours in a former note. I kept it on purpose to refer\\r\\nto it at a proper time, and then forgot it. I like the name \"Which is\\r\\nthe Heroine\" very well, and I dare say shall grow to like it very much\\r\\nin time; but \"Enthusiasm\" was something so very superior that my common\\r\\ntitle must appear to disadvantage. I am not sensible of any blunders\\r\\nabout Dawlish; the library was pitiful and wretched twelve years ago,\\r\\nand not likely to have anybody\\'s publications. There is no such title as\\r\\nDesborough, either among dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, or barons.\\r\\nThese were your inquiries. I will now thank you for your envelope\\r\\nreceived this morning. Your Aunt Cass is as well pleased with St. Julian\\r\\nas ever, and I am delighted with the idea of seeing Progillian again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wednesday_, 17.--We have now just finished the first of the three books\\r\\nI had the pleasure of receiving yesterday. I read it aloud, and we are\\r\\nall very much amused, and like the work quite as well as ever. I depend\\r\\non getting through another book before dinner, but there is really a\\r\\ngood deal of respectable reading in your forty-eight pages. I have no\\r\\ndoubt six would make a very good-sized volume. You must have been quite\\r\\npleased to have accomplished so much. I like Lord Portman and his\\r\\nbrother very much. I am only afraid that Lord P.\\'s good nature will make\\r\\nmost people like him better than he deserves. The whole family are very\\r\\ngood; and Lady Anne, who was your great dread, you have succeeded\\r\\nparticularly well with. Bell Griffin is just what she should be. My\\r\\ncorrections have not been more important than before; here and there we\\r\\nhave thought the sense could be expressed in fewer words, and I have\\r\\nscratched out Sir Thos. from walking with the others to the stables,\\r\\netc. the very day after breaking his arm; for though I find your papa\\r\\ndid walk out immediately after his arm was set, I think it can be so\\r\\nlittle usual as to appear unnatural in a book. Lynn will not do. Lynn is\\r\\ntowards forty miles from Dawlish and would not be talked of there. I\\r\\nhave put Starcross instead. If you prefer Easton, that must be always\\r\\nsafe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have also scratched out the introduction between Lord Portman and his\\r\\nbrother and Mr. Griffin. A country surgeon (don\\'t tell Mr. C. Lyford)\\r\\nwould not be introduced to men of their rank; and when Mr. P. is first\\r\\nbrought in, he would not be introduced as the Honorable. That\\r\\ndistinction is never mentioned at such times; at least, I believe not.\\r\\nNow we have finished the second book, or rather the fifth. I do think\\r\\nyou had better omit Lady Helena\\'s postscript. To those that are\\r\\nacquainted with \"Pride and Prejudice\" it will seem an imitation. And\\r\\nyour Aunt C. and I both recommend your making a little alteration in the\\r\\nlast scene between Devereux F. and Lady Clanmurray and her daughter. We\\r\\nthink they press him too much, more than sensible or well-bred women\\r\\nwould do; Lady C., at least, should have discretion enough to be sooner\\r\\nsatisfied with his determination of not going with them. I am very much\\r\\npleased with Egerton as yet. I did not expect to like him, but I do, and\\r\\nSusan is a very nice little animated creature; but St. Julian is the\\r\\ndelight of our lives. He is quite interesting. The whole of his\\r\\nbreak-off with Lady Helena is very well done. Yes; Russell Square is a\\r\\nvery proper distance from Berkeley Square. We are reading the last book.\\r\\nThey must be two days going from Dawlish to Bath. They are nearly one\\r\\nhundred miles apart.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Thursday._--We finished it last night after our return from drinking\\r\\ntea at the Great House. The last chapter does not please us quite so\\r\\nwell; we do not thoroughly like the play, perhaps from having had too\\r\\nmuch of plays in that way lately (_vide_ \"Mansfield Park\"), and we think\\r\\nyou had better not leave England. Let the Portmans go to Ireland; but as\\r\\nyou know nothing of the manners there, you had better not go with them.\\r\\nYou will be in danger of giving false representations. Stick to Bath and\\r\\nthe Foresters. There you will be quite at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Aunt C. does not like desultory novels, and is rather afraid yours\\r\\nwill be too much so, that there will be too frequently a change from one\\r\\nset of people to another, and that circumstances will be introduced of\\r\\napparent consequence which will lead to nothing. It will not be so great\\r\\nan objection to me if it does. I allow much more latitude than she does,\\r\\nand think Nature and spirit cover many sins of a wandering story, and\\r\\npeople in general do not care so much about it for your comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should like to have had more of Devereux. I do not feel enough\\r\\nacquainted with him. You were afraid of meddling with him, I dare say. I\\r\\nlike your sketch of Lord Clanmurray, and your picture of the two young\\r\\ngirls\\' enjoyment is very good. I have not noticed St. Julian\\'s serious\\r\\nconversation with Cecilia, but I like it exceedingly. What he says about\\r\\nthe madness of otherwise sensible women on the subject of their\\r\\ndaughters coming out is worth its weight in gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not perceive that the language sinks. Pray go on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                     CHAWTON, Sept. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR ANNA,--We have been very much amused by your three books, but I\\r\\nhave a good many criticisms to make, more than you will like. We are not\\r\\nsatisfied with Mrs. Forester settling herself as tenant and near\\r\\nneighbor to such a man as Sir Thomas, without having some other\\r\\ninducement to go there. She ought to have some friend living thereabouts\\r\\nto tempt her. A woman going with two girls just growing up into a\\r\\nneighborhood where she knows nobody but one man of not very good\\r\\ncharacter, is an awkwardness which so prudent a woman as Mrs. F. would\\r\\nnot be likely to fall into. Remember she is very prudent. You must not\\r\\nlet her act inconsistently. Give her a friend, and let that friend be\\r\\ninvited by Sir Thomas H. to meet her, and we shall have no objection to\\r\\nher dining at the Priory as she does; but otherwise a woman in her\\r\\nsituation would hardly go there before she had been visited by other\\r\\nfamilies. I like the scene itself, the Miss Leslie, Lady Anne, and the\\r\\nmusic very much. Leslie is a noble name. Sir Thomas H. you always do\\r\\nvery well. I have only taken the liberty of expunging one phrase of his\\r\\nwhich would not be allowable,--\"Bless my heart!\" It is too familiar and\\r\\ninelegant. Your grandmother is more disturbed at Mrs. Forester\\'s not\\r\\nreturning the Egertons\\' visit sooner than by anything else. They ought\\r\\nto have called at the Parsonage before Sunday. You describe a sweet\\r\\nplace, but your descriptions are often more minute than will be liked.\\r\\nYou give too many particulars of right hand and left. Mrs. Forester is\\r\\nnot careful enough of Susan\\'s health. Susan ought not to be walking out\\r\\nso soon after heavy rains, taking long walks in the dirt. An anxious\\r\\nmother would not suffer it. I like your Susan very much; she is a sweet\\r\\ncreature, her playfulness of fancy is very delightful. I like her as she\\r\\nis now exceedingly, but I am not quite so well satisfied with her\\r\\nbehavior to George R. At first she seems all over attachment and\\r\\nfeeling, and afterwards to have none at all; she is so extremely\\r\\nconfused at the ball, and so well satisfied apparently with Mr. Morgan.\\r\\nShe seems to have changed her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are now collecting your people delightfully, getting them exactly\\r\\ninto such a spot as is the delight of my life. Three or four families in\\r\\na country village is the very thing to work on, and I hope you will do a\\r\\ngreat deal more, and make full use of them while they are so very\\r\\nfavorably arranged.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are but now coming to the heart and beauty of your story. Until the\\r\\nheroine grows up the fun must be imperfect, but I expect a great deal of\\r\\nentertainment from the next three or four books, and I hope you will not\\r\\nresent these remarks by sending me no more. We like the Egertons very\\r\\nwell. We see no blue pantaloons or cocks or hens. There is nothing to\\r\\nenchant one certainly in Mr. L. L., but we make no objection to him, and\\r\\nhis inclination to like Susan is pleasing. The sister is a good\\r\\ncontrast, but the name of Rachel is as much as I can bear. They are not\\r\\nso much like the Papillons as I expected. Your last chapter is very\\r\\nentertaining, the conversation on genius, etc.; Mr. St. Julian and Susan\\r\\nboth talk in character, and very well. In some former parts Cecilia is\\r\\nperhaps a little too solemn and good, but upon the whole her disposition\\r\\nis very well opposed to Susan\\'s, her want of imagination is very\\r\\nnatural. I wish you could make Mrs. Forester talk more; but she must be\\r\\ndifficult to manage and make entertaining, because there is so much good\\r\\nsense and propriety about her that nothing can be made very broad. Her\\r\\neconomy and her ambition must not be staring. The papers left by Mrs.\\r\\nFisher are very good. Of course one guesses something. I hope when you\\r\\nhave written a great deal more, you will be equal to scratching out some\\r\\nof the past. The scene with Mrs. Mellish I should condemn; it is prosy\\r\\nand nothing to the purpose, and indeed the more you can find in your\\r\\nheart to curtail between Dawlish and Newton Priors, the better I think\\r\\nit will be,--one does not care for girls until they are grown up. Your\\r\\nAunt C. quite understands the exquisiteness of that name,--Newton Priors\\r\\nis really a nonpareil. Milton would have given his eyes to have thought\\r\\nof it. Is not the cottage taken from Tollard Royal?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Thus far the letter was written on the 9th, but before it was finished\\r\\nnews arrived at Chawton of the death of Mrs. Charles Austen. She died in\\r\\nher confinement, and the baby died also. She left three little\\r\\ngirls,--Cassie, Harriet, and Fanny. It was not until the 18th that Jane\\r\\nresumed her letter as follows:[32]]\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sunday._--I am very glad, dear Anna, that I wrote as I did before this\\r\\nsad event occurred. I have only to add that your grandmamma does not\\r\\nseem the worse now for the shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall be very happy to receive more of your work if more is ready; and\\r\\nyou write so fast that I have great hopes Mr. Digweed will come back\\r\\nfreighted with such a cargo as not all his hops or his sheep could equal\\r\\nthe value of.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour grandmamma desires me to say that she will have finished your shoes\\r\\nto-morrow, and thinks they will look very well. And that she depends\\r\\nupon seeing you, as you promise, before you quit the country, and hopes\\r\\nyou will give her more than a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n                               Yours affectionately.       J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[32] Note by Lord Brabourne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  CHAWTON, Wednesday (Sept. 28).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR ANNA,--I hope you do not depend on having your book again\\r\\nimmediately. I kept it that your grandmamma may hear it, for it has not\\r\\nbeen possible yet to have any public reading. I have read it to your\\r\\nAunt Cassandra, however, in our own room at night, while we undressed,\\r\\nand with a great deal of pleasure. We like the first chapter extremely,\\r\\nwith only a little doubt whether Lady Helena is not almost too foolish.\\r\\nThe matrimonial dialogue is very good certainly. I like Susan as well as\\r\\never, and begin now not to care at all about Cecilia; she may stay at\\r\\nEaston Court as long as she likes. Henry Mellish will be, I am afraid,\\r\\ntoo much in the common novel style,--a handsome, amiable,\\r\\nunexceptionable young man (such as do not much abound in real life),\\r\\ndesperately in love and all in vain. But I have no business to judge him\\r\\nso early Jane Egerton is a very natural, comprehensible girl, and the\\r\\nwhole of her acquaintance with Susan and Susan\\'s letter to Cecilia are\\r\\nvery pleasing and quite in character. But Miss Egerton does not entirely\\r\\nsatisfy us. She is too formal and solemn, we think, in her advice to her\\r\\nbrother not to fall in love; and it is hardly like a sensible woman,--it\\r\\nis putting it into his head. We should like a few hints from her better.\\r\\nWe feel really obliged to you for introducing a Lady Kenrick; it will\\r\\nremove the greatest fault in the work, and I give you credit for\\r\\nconsiderable forbearance as an author in adopting so much of our\\r\\nopinion. I expect high fun about Mrs. Fisher and Sir Thomas. You have\\r\\nbeen perfectly right in telling Ben. Lefroy of your work, and I am very\\r\\nglad to hear how much he likes it. His encouragement and approbation\\r\\nmust be \"quite beyond everything.\"[33] I do not at all wonder at his not\\r\\nexpecting to like anybody so well as Cecilia at first, but I shall be\\r\\nsurprised if he does not become a Susanite in time. Devereux Forester\\'s\\r\\nbeing ruined by his vanity is extremely good, but I wish you would not\\r\\nlet him plunge into a \"vortex of dissipation.\" I do not object to the\\r\\nthing, but I cannot bear the expression; it is such thorough novel\\r\\nslang, and so old that I dare say Adam met with it in the first novel\\r\\nhe opened. Indeed, I did very much like to know Ben\\'s opinion. I hope he\\r\\nwill continue to be pleased with it, and I think he must, but I cannot\\r\\nflatter him with there being much incident. We have no great right to\\r\\nwonder at his not valuing the name of Progillian. That is a source of\\r\\ndelight which even he can hardly be quite competent to.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. It\\r\\nis not fair. He has fame and profit enough as a poet, and should not be\\r\\ntaking the bread out of the mouths of other people.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not like him, and do not mean to like \"Waverley\" if I can help it,\\r\\nbut fear I must.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am quite determined, however, not to be pleased with Mrs. West\\'s\\r\\n\"Alicia De Lacy,\" should I ever meet with it, which I hope I shall not.\\r\\nI think I can be stout against anything written by Mrs. West. I have\\r\\nmade up my mind to like no novels really but Miss Edgeworth\\'s, yours,\\r\\nand my own.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can you do with Egerton to increase the interest for him? I wish\\r\\nyou could contrive something, some family occurrence to bring out his\\r\\ngood qualities more. Some distress among brothers and sisters to relieve\\r\\nby the sale of his curacy! Something to carry him mysteriously away, and\\r\\nthen be heard of at York or Edinburgh in an old greatcoat. I would not\\r\\nseriously recommend anything improbable, but if you could invent\\r\\nsomething spirited for him, it would have a good effect. He might lend\\r\\nall his money to Captain Morris, but then he would be a great fool if he\\r\\ndid. Cannot the Morrises quarrel and he reconcile them? Excuse the\\r\\nliberty I take in these suggestions.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Aunt Frank\\'s nursemaid has just given her warning, but whether she\\r\\nis worth your having, or would take your place, I know not. She was Mrs.\\r\\nWebb\\'s maid before she went to the Great House. She leaves your aunt\\r\\nbecause she cannot agree with the other servants. She is in love with\\r\\nthe man, and her head seems rather turned. He returns her affection, but\\r\\nshe fancies every one else is wanting him and envying her. Her previous\\r\\nservice must have fitted her for such a place as yours, and she is very\\r\\nactive and cleanly. The Webbs are really gone! When I saw the wagons at\\r\\nthe door, and thought of all the trouble they must have in moving, I\\r\\nbegan to reproach myself for not having liked them better; but since the\\r\\nwagons have disappeared my conscience has been closed again, and I am\\r\\nexcessively glad they are gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very fond of Sherlock\\'s sermons, and prefer them to almost any.\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Your affectionate aunt,        J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you wish me to speak to the maid, let me know.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[33] A phrase always in the mouth of one of the Chawton neighbors, Mrs.\\r\\nH. Digweed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n    _To Miss Frances Austen._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  CHAWTON, Friday (Nov. 18, 1814).\\r\\n\\r\\nI FEEL quite as doubtful as you could be, my dearest Fanny, as to when\\r\\nmy letter may be finished, for I can command very little quiet time at\\r\\npresent; but yet I must begin, for I know you will be glad to hear as\\r\\nsoon as possible, and I really am impatient myself to be writing\\r\\nsomething on so very interesting a subject, though I have no hope of\\r\\nwriting anything to the purpose. I shall do very little more, I dare\\r\\nsay, than say over again what you have said before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was certainly a good deal surprised at first, as I had no suspicion of\\r\\nany change in your feelings, and I have no scruple in saying that you\\r\\ncannot be in love. My dear Fanny, I am ready to laugh at the idea, and\\r\\nyet it is no laughing matter to have had you so mistaken as to your own\\r\\nfeelings. And with all my heart I wish I had cautioned you on that point\\r\\nwhen first you spoke to me; but though I did not think you then much in\\r\\nlove, I did consider you as being attached in a degree quite\\r\\nsufficiently for happiness, as I had no doubt it would increase with\\r\\nopportunity, and from the time of our being in London together I thought\\r\\nyou really very much in love. But you certainly are not at all--there is\\r\\nno concealing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat strange creatures we are! It seems as if your being secure of him\\r\\nhad made you indifferent. There was a little disgust, I suspect, at the\\r\\nraces, and I do not wonder at it. His expressions then would not do for\\r\\none who had rather more acuteness, penetration, and taste, than love,\\r\\nwhich was your case. And yet, after all, I am surprised that the change\\r\\nin your feelings should be so great. He is just what he ever was, only\\r\\nmore evidently and uniformly devoted to you. This is all the difference.\\r\\nHow shall we account for it?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dearest Fanny, I am writing what will not be of the smallest use to\\r\\nyou. I am feeling differently every moment, and shall not be able to\\r\\nsuggest a single thing that can assist your mind. I could lament in one\\r\\nsentence and laugh in the next, but as to opinion or counsel I am sure\\r\\nthat none will be extracted worth having from this letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI read yours through the very evening I received it, getting away by\\r\\nmyself. I could not bear to leave off when I had once begun. I was full\\r\\nof curiosity and concern. Luckily your At. C. dined at the other house;\\r\\ntherefore I had not to manoeuvre away from her, and as to anybody else,\\r\\nI do not care.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor dear Mr. A.! Oh, dear Fanny! your mistake has been one that\\r\\nthousands of women fall into. He was the first young man who attached\\r\\nhimself to you. That was the charm, and most powerful it is. Among the\\r\\nmultitudes, however, that make the same mistake with yourself, there can\\r\\nbe few indeed who have so little reason to regret it; his character and\\r\\nhis attachment leave you nothing to be ashamed of.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the whole, what is to be done? You have no inclination for any\\r\\nother person. His situation in life, family, friends, and, above all,\\r\\nhis character, his uncommonly amiable mind, strict principles, just\\r\\nnotions, good habits, all that you know so well how to value, all that\\r\\nis really of the first importance,--everything of this nature pleads his\\r\\ncause most strongly. You have no doubt of his having superior abilities,\\r\\nhe has proved it at the University; he is, I dare say, such a scholar as\\r\\nyour agreeable, idle brothers would ill bear a comparison with.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, my dear Fanny! the more I write about him the warmer my feelings\\r\\nbecome,--the more strongly I feel the sterling worth of such a young\\r\\nman, and the desirableness of your growing in love with him again. I\\r\\nrecommend this most thoroughly. There are such beings in the world,\\r\\nperhaps one in a thousand, as the creature you and I should think\\r\\nperfection, where grace and spirit are united to worth, where the\\r\\nmanners are equal to the heart and understanding; but such a person may\\r\\nnot come in your way, or, if he does, he may not be the eldest son of a\\r\\nman of fortune, the near relation of your particular friend, and\\r\\nbelonging to your own county.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of all this, Fanny. Mr. A. has advantages which we do not often\\r\\nmeet in one person. His only fault, indeed, seems modesty. If he were\\r\\nless modest, he would be more agreeable, speak louder, and look\\r\\nimpudenter; and is not it a fine character of which modesty is the only\\r\\ndefect? I have no doubt he will get more lively and more like yourselves\\r\\nas he is more with you; he will catch your ways if he belongs to you.\\r\\nAnd as to there being any objection from his goodness, from the danger\\r\\nof his becoming even evangelical, I cannot admit that. I am by no means\\r\\nconvinced that we ought not all to be evangelicals, and am at least\\r\\npersuaded that they who are so from reason and feeling must be happiest\\r\\nand safest. Do not be frightened from the connection by your brothers\\r\\nhaving most wit,--wisdom is better than wit, and in the long run will\\r\\ncertainly have the laugh on her side; and don\\'t be frightened by the\\r\\nidea of his acting more strictly up to the precepts of the New Testament\\r\\nthan others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, my dear Fanny, having written so much on one side of the\\r\\nquestion, I shall turn round and entreat you not to commit yourself\\r\\nfarther, and not to think of accepting him unless you really do like\\r\\nhim. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying\\r\\nwithout affection; and if his deficiencies of manner, etc., etc.,\\r\\nstrike you more than all his good qualities, if you continue to think\\r\\nstrongly of them, give him up at once. Things are now in such a state\\r\\nthat you must resolve upon one or the other,--either to allow him to go\\r\\non as he has done, or whenever you are together behave with a coldness\\r\\nwhich may convince him that he has been deceiving himself. I have no\\r\\ndoubt of his suffering a good deal for a time,--a great deal when he\\r\\nfeels that he must give you up; but it is no creed of mine, as you must\\r\\nbe well aware, that such sort of disappointments kill anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour sending the music was an admirable device, it made everything easy,\\r\\nand I do not know how I could have accounted for the parcel otherwise;\\r\\nfor though your dear papa most conscientiously hunted about till he\\r\\nfound me alone in the dining-parlor, your Aunt C. had seen that he had a\\r\\nparcel to deliver. As it was, however, I do not think anything was\\r\\nsuspected.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have heard nothing fresh from Anna. I trust she is very comfortable\\r\\nin her new home. Her letters have been very sensible and satisfactory,\\r\\nwith no parade of happiness, which I liked them the better for. I have\\r\\noften known young married women write in a way I did not like in that\\r\\nrespect.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will be glad to hear that the first edition of M. P.[34] is all\\r\\nsold. Your Uncle Henry is rather wanting me to come to town to settle\\r\\nabout a second edition; but as I could not very conveniently leave home\\r\\nnow, I have written him my will and pleasure and unless he still urges\\r\\nit, shall not go. I am very greedy and want to make the most of it; but\\r\\nas you are much above caring about money, I shall not plague you with\\r\\nany particulars. The pleasures of vanity are more within your\\r\\ncomprehension, and you will enter into mine at receiving the praise\\r\\nwhich every now and then comes to me through some channel or other.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Saturday._--Mr. Palmer spent yesterday with us, and is gone off with\\r\\nCassy this morning. We have been expecting Miss Lloyd the last two days,\\r\\nand feel sure of her to-day. Mr. Knight and Mr. Edwd. Knight are to dine\\r\\nwith us, and on Monday they are to dine with us again, accompanied by\\r\\ntheir respectable host and hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sunday._--Your papa had given me messages to you; but they are\\r\\nunnecessary, as he writes by this post to Aunt Louisa. We had a pleasant\\r\\nparty yesterday; at least we found it so. It is delightful to see him so\\r\\ncheerful and confident. Aunt Cass. and I dine at the Great House to-day.\\r\\nWe shall be a snug half-dozen. Miss Lloyd came, as we expected,\\r\\nyesterday, and desires her love. She is very happy to hear of your\\r\\nlearning the harp.

She gave me her\\r\\ncongratulations, and desired they might be forwarded to you, and there\\r\\nthey are. The chief news from this country is the death of old Mrs.\\r\\nDormer. Mrs. Clement walks about in a new black velvet pelisse lined\\r\\nwith yellow, and a white bobbin net veil, and looks remarkably well in\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I understand the country about Hendon from your description. It\\r\\nmust be very pretty in summer. Should you know from the atmosphere that\\r\\nyou were within a dozen miles of London? Make everybody at Hendon admire\\r\\n\"Mansfield Park.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    Your affectionate aunt,       J.

We talked of you for about a mile and a half with great\\r\\nsatisfaction; and I have been just sending a very good report of you to\\r\\nMiss Benn, with a full account of your dress for Susan and Maria.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were all at the play last night to see Miss O\\'Neil in \"Isabella.\" I\\r\\ndo not think she was quite equal to my expectations. I fancy I want\\r\\nsomething more than can be. I took two pocket-handkerchiefs, but had\\r\\nvery little occasion for either. She is an elegant creature, however,\\r\\nand hugs Mr. Young delightfully. I am going this morning to see the\\r\\nlittle girls in Keppel Street. Cassy was excessively interested about\\r\\nyour marriage when she heard of it, which was not until she was to drink\\r\\nyour health on the wedding-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe asked a thousand questions in her usual manner, what he said to you\\r\\nand what you said to him. If your uncle were at home he would send his\\r\\nbest love, but I will not impose any base fictitious remembrances on\\r\\nyou; mine I can honestly give, and remain\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        Your affectionate aunt,\\r\\n                                                          J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               HANS PLACE, Wednesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR ANNA,--I have been very far from finding your book an evil, I\\r\\nassure you. I read it immediately and with great pleasure. I think you\\r\\nare going on very well. The description of Dr. Griffin and Lady Helena\\'s\\r\\nunhappiness is very good, and just what was likely to be. I am curious\\r\\nto know what the end of them will be. The name of Newton Priors is\\r\\nreally invaluable; I never met with anything superior to it. It is\\r\\ndelightful, and one could live on the name of Newton Priors for a\\r\\ntwelvemonth. Indeed, I think you get on very fast. I only wish other\\r\\npeople of my acquaintance could compose as rapidly. I am pleased with\\r\\nthe dog scene and with the whole of George and Susan\\'s love, but am more\\r\\nparticularly struck with your serious conversations. They are very good\\r\\nthroughout. St. Julian\\'s history was quite a surprise to me. You had not\\r\\nvery long known it yourself, I suspect; but I have no objection to make\\r\\nto the circumstance, and it is very well told. His having been in love\\r\\nwith the aunt gives Cecilia an additional interest with him. I like the\\r\\nidea,--a very proper compliment to an aunt! I rather imagine indeed that\\r\\nnieces are seldom chosen but out of compliment to some aunt or another.\\r\\nI dare say Ben was in love with me once, and would never have thought of\\r\\nyou if he had not supposed me dead of scarlet fever. Yes, I was in a\\r\\nmistake as to the number of books. I thought I had read three before the\\r\\nthree at Chawton, but fewer than six will not do. I want to see dear\\r\\nBell Griffin again; and had you not better give some hint of St.\\r\\nJulian\\'s early history in the beginning of the story?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall see nothing of Streatham while we are in town, as Mrs. Hill is\\r\\nto lie in of a daughter. Mrs. Blackstone is to be with her. Mrs.\\r\\nHeathcote and Miss Bigg[35] are just leaving. The latter writes me word\\r\\nthat Miss Blackford is married, but I have never seen it in the papers,\\r\\nand one may as well be single if the wedding is not to be in print.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Your affectionate aunt,      J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                            23 HANS PLACE, Wednesday (Nov. 30, 1814).\\r\\n\\r\\nI AM very much obliged to you, my dear Fanny, for your letter, and I\\r\\nhope you will write again soon, that I may know you to be all safe and\\r\\nhappy at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visit to Hendon will interest you, I am sure; but I need not enter\\r\\ninto the particulars of it, as your papa will be able to answer almost\\r\\nevery question. I certainly could describe her bedroom and her drawers\\r\\nand her closet better than he can, but I do not feel that I can stop to\\r\\ndo it. I was rather sorry to hear that she is to have an instrument; it\\r\\nseems throwing money away. They will wish the twenty-four guineas in the\\r\\nshape of sheets and towels six months hence; and as to her playing, it\\r\\nnever can be anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer purple pelisse rather surprised me. I thought we had known all\\r\\nparaphernalia of that sort. I do not mean to blame her; it looked very\\r\\nwell, and I dare say she wanted it. I suspect nothing worse than its\\r\\nbeing got in secret, and not owned to anybody. I received a very kind\\r\\nnote from her yesterday, to ask me to come again and stay a night with\\r\\nthem. I cannot do it, but I was pleased to find that she had the power\\r\\nof doing so right a thing. My going was to give them both pleasure very\\r\\nproperly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI just saw Mr. Hayter at the play, and think his face would please me on\\r\\nacquaintance. I was sorry he did not dine here. It seemed rather odd to\\r\\nme to be in the theatre with nobody to watch for. I was quite composed\\r\\nmyself, at leisure for all the agitated Isabella could raise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, my dearest Fanny, I will begin a subject which comes in very\\r\\nnaturally. You frighten me out of my wits by your reference. Your\\r\\naffection gives me the highest pleasure, but indeed you must not let\\r\\nanything depend on my opinion; your own feelings, and none but your own,\\r\\nshould determine such an important point. So far, however, as answering\\r\\nyour question, I have no scruple. I am perfectly convinced that your\\r\\npresent feelings, supposing that you were to marry now, would be\\r\\nsufficient for his happiness; but when I think how very, very far it is\\r\\nfrom a \"now,\" and take everything that may be into consideration, I dare\\r\\nnot say, \"Determine to accept him;\" the risk is too great for you,\\r\\nunless your own sentiments prompt it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will think me perverse, perhaps; in my last letter I was urging\\r\\neverything in his favor, and now I am inclining the other way, but I\\r\\ncannot help it; I am at present more impressed with the possible evil\\r\\nthat may arise to you from engaging yourself to him--in word or\\r\\nmind--than with anything else. When I consider how few young men you\\r\\nhave yet seen much of, how capable you are (yes, I do still think you\\r\\nvery capable) of being really in love, and how full of temptation the\\r\\nnext six or seven years of your life will probably be (it is the very\\r\\nperiod of life for the strongest attachments to be formed),--I cannot\\r\\nwish you, with your present very cool feelings, to devote yourself in\\r\\nhonor to him. It is very true that you never may attach another man his\\r\\nequal altogether; but if that other man has the power of attaching you\\r\\nmore, he will be in your eyes the most perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall be glad if you can revive past feelings, and from your unbiassed\\r\\nself resolve to go on as you have done, but this I do not expect; and\\r\\nwithout it I cannot wish you to be fettered. I should not be afraid of\\r\\nyour marrying him; with all his worth you would soon love him enough for\\r\\nthe happiness of both; but I should dread the continuance of this sort\\r\\nof tacit engagement, with such an uncertainty as there is of when it may\\r\\nbe completed. Years may pass before he is independent; you like him well\\r\\nenough to marry, but not well enough to wait; the unpleasantness of\\r\\nappearing fickle is certainly great; but if you think you want\\r\\npunishment for past illusions, there it is, and nothing can be compared\\r\\nto the misery of being bound without love,--bound to one, and preferring\\r\\nanother; that is a punishment which you do not deserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know you did not meet, or rather will not meet, to-day, as he called\\r\\nhere yesterday; and I am glad of it. It does not seem very likely, at\\r\\nleast, that he should be in time for a dinner visit sixty miles off. We\\r\\ndid not see him, only found his card when we came home at four. Your\\r\\nUncle H. merely observed that he was a day after \"the fair.\" We asked\\r\\nyour brother on Monday (when Mr. Hayter was talked of) why he did not\\r\\ninvite him too; saying, \"I know he is in town, for I met him the other\\r\\nday in Bond St.\" Edward answered that he did not know where he was to be\\r\\nfound. \"Don\\'t you know his chambers?\" \"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall be most glad to hear from you again, my dearest Fanny, but it\\r\\nmust not be later than Saturday, as we shall be off on Monday long\\r\\nbefore the letters are delivered; and write something that may do to be\\r\\nread or told. I am to take the Miss Moores back on Saturday, and when I\\r\\nreturn I shall hope to find your pleasant little flowing scrawl on the\\r\\ntable. It will be a relief to me after playing at ma\\'ams, for though I\\r\\nlike Miss H. M. as much as one can at my time of life after a day\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance, it is uphill work to be talking to those whom one knows so\\r\\nlittle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one comes back with me to-morrow, probably Miss Eliza, and I rather\\r\\ndread it. We shall not have two ideas in common. She is young, pretty,\\r\\nchattering, and thinking chiefly, I presume, of dress, company, and\\r\\nadmiration. Mr. Sanford is to join us at dinner, which will be a\\r\\ncomfort, and in the evening, while your uncle and Miss Eliza play chess,\\r\\nhe shall tell me comical things and I will laugh at them, which will be\\r\\na pleasure to both.\\r\\n\\r\\nI called in Keppel Street and saw them all, including dear Uncle\\r\\nCharles, who is to come and dine with us quietly to-day. Little Harriot\\r\\nsat in my lap, and seemed as gentle and affectionate as ever, and as\\r\\npretty, except not being quite well. Fanny is a fine stout girl, talking\\r\\nincessantly, with an interesting degree of lisp and indistinctness, and\\r\\nvery likely may be the handsomest in time. Cassy did not show more\\r\\npleasure in seeing me than her sisters, but I expected no better. She\\r\\ndoes not shine in the tender feelings. She will never be a Miss O\\'Neil,\\r\\nmore in the Mrs. Siddons line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, but it is not settled yet whether I do hazard a second\\r\\nedition. We are to see Egerton to-day, when it will probably be\\r\\ndetermined. People are more ready to borrow and praise than to buy,\\r\\nwhich I cannot wonder at; but though I like praise as well as anybody, I\\r\\nlike what Edward calls \"Pewter\" too. I hope he continues careful of his\\r\\neyes, and finds the good effect of it. I cannot suppose we differ in our\\r\\nideas of the Christian religion. You have given an excellent description\\r\\nof it. We only affix a different meaning to the word _evangelical_.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours most affectionately,\\r\\n                                                      J.

Lefroy that if the weather did not prevent\\r\\nus we should certainly come and see you to-morrow and bring Cassy,\\r\\ntrusting to your being good enough to give her a dinner about one\\r\\no\\'clock, that we might be able to be with you the earlier and stay the\\r\\nlonger. But on giving Cassy her choice between the Fair at Alton or\\r\\nWyards, it must be confessed that she has preferred the former, which we\\r\\ntrust will not greatly affront you; if it does, you may hope that some\\r\\nlittle Anne hereafter may revenge the insult by a similar preference of\\r\\nan Alton Fair to her Cousin Cassy. In the mean while we have determined\\r\\nto put off our visit to you until Monday, which we hope will be not less\\r\\nconvenient. I wish the weather may not resolve on another put off. I\\r\\nmust come to you before Wednesday if it be possible, for on that day I\\r\\nam going to London for a week or two with your Uncle Henry, who is\\r\\nexpected here on Sunday. If Monday should appear too dirty for walking,\\r\\nand Mr. Lefroy would be so kind as to come and fetch me, I should be\\r\\nmuch obliged to him. Cassy might be of the party, and your Aunt\\r\\nCassandra will take another opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Yours very affectionately, my dear Anna,\\r\\n                                                    J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note by Lord Brabourne._\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before the week or two to which she had limited her visit in Hans\\r\\nPlace was at an end, her brother fell ill, and on October 22 he was in\\r\\nsuch danger that she wrote to Steventon to summon her father to town.\\r\\nThe letter was two days on the road, and reached him on Sunday the 24th.\\r\\nEven then he did not start immediately. In the evening he and his wife\\r\\nrode to Chawton, and it was not until the next day that he and Cassandra\\r\\narrived in Hans Place. The malady from which Henry Austen was suffering\\r\\nwas low fever, and he was for some days at death\\'s door: but he rallied\\r\\nsoon after his brother and sisters arrived, and recovered so quickly\\r\\nthat the former was able to leave him at the end of the week. The great\\r\\nanxiety and fatigue which Jane underwent at this time was supposed by\\r\\nsome of her family to have broken down her health. She was in a very\\r\\nfeeble and exhausted condition when the bank in which her brother Henry\\r\\nwas a partner broke, and he not only lost all that he possessed, but\\r\\nmost of his relations suffered severely also. Jane was well enough to\\r\\npay several visits with her sister in the summer of 1816, including one\\r\\nto Steventon,--the last she ever paid to that home of her childhood. The\\r\\nlast note which Mrs. Lefroy had preserved is dated,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                        JUNE 23, 1816.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR ANNA,--Cassy desires her best thanks for the book. She was quite\\r\\ndelighted to see it. I do not know when I have seen her so much struck\\r\\nby anybody\\'s kindness as on this occasion. Her sensibility seems to be\\r\\nopening to the perception of great actions. These gloves having appeared\\r\\non the pianoforte ever since you were here on Friday, we imagine they\\r\\nmust be yours. Mrs. Digweed returned yesterday through all the\\r\\nafternoon\\'s rain, and was of course wet through; but in speaking of it\\r\\nshe never once said \"it was beyond everything,\" which I am sure it must\\r\\nhave been. Your mamma means to ride to Speen Hill to-morrow to see the\\r\\nMrs. Hulberts, who are both very indifferent. By all accounts they\\r\\nreally are breaking now,--not so stout as the old jackass.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours affectionately,       J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHAWTON, Sunday, June 23.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Charles\\'s birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  HANS PLACE, Friday (Nov. 24, 1815).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I have the pleasure of sending you a much better\\r\\naccount of my affairs, which I know will be a great delight to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote to Mr. Murray yesterday myself, and Henry wrote at the same time\\r\\nto Roworth. Before the notes were out of the house, I received three\\r\\nsheets and an apology from R. We sent the notes, however, and I had a\\r\\nmost civil one in reply from Mr. M. He is so very polite, indeed, that\\r\\nit is quite overcoming. The printers have been waiting for paper,--the\\r\\nblame is thrown upon the stationer; but he gives his word that I shall\\r\\nhave no further cause for dissatisfaction. He has lent us Miss Williams\\r\\nand Scott, and says that any book of his will always be at my service.\\r\\nIn short, I am soothed and complimented into tolerable comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a visit yesterday from Edwd. Knight, and Mr. Mascall joined him\\r\\nhere; and this morning has brought Mr. Mascall\\'s compliments and two\\r\\npheasants. We have some hope of Edward\\'s coming to dinner to-day; he\\r\\nwill, if he can, I believe. He is looking extremely well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-morrow Mr. Haden is to dine with us. There is happiness! We really\\r\\ngrow so fond of Mr. Haden that I do not know what to expect. He and Mr.\\r\\nTilson and Mr. Philips made up our circle of wits last night. Fanny\\r\\nplayed, and he sat and listened and suggested improvements, till Richard\\r\\ncame in to tell him that \"the doctor was waiting for him at Captn.\\r\\nBlake\\'s;\" and then he was off with a speed that you can imagine. He\\r\\nnever does appear in the least above his profession or out of humor\\r\\nwith it, or I should think poor Captn. Blake, whoever he is, in a very\\r\\nbad way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must have misunderstood Henry when I told you that you were to hear\\r\\nfrom him to-day. He read me what he wrote to Edward: part of it must\\r\\nhave amused him, I am sure one part, alas! cannot be very amusing to\\r\\nanybody. I wonder that with such business to worry him he can be getting\\r\\nbetter; but he certainly does gain strength, and if you and Edwd. were\\r\\nto see him now, I feel sure that you would think him improved since\\r\\nMonday.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was out yesterday; it was a fine sunshiny day here (in the country\\r\\nperhaps you might have clouds and fogs. Dare I say so? I shall not\\r\\ndeceive you, if I do, as to my estimation of the climate of London), and\\r\\nhe ventured first on the balcony and then as far as the greenhouse. He\\r\\ncaught no cold, and therefore has done more to-day, with great delight\\r\\nand self-persuasion of improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has been to see Mrs. Tilson and the Malings. By the by, you may talk\\r\\nto Mr. T. of his wife\\'s being better; I saw her yesterday, and was\\r\\nsensible of her having gained ground in the last two days.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Evening._--We have had no Edward. Our circle is formed,--only Mr.\\r\\nTilson and Mr. Haden. We are not so happy as we were. A message came\\r\\nthis afternoon from Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, offering themselves to\\r\\ndrink tea with us to-morrow, and, as it was accepted, here is an end of\\r\\nour extreme felicity in our dinner guest. I am heartily sorry they are\\r\\ncoming; it will be an evening spoilt to Fanny and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother little disappointment: Mr. H. advises Henry\\'s not venturing with\\r\\nus in the carriage to-morrow; if it were spring, he says, it would be a\\r\\ndifferent thing. One would rather this had not been. He seems to think\\r\\nhis going out to-day rather imprudent, though acknowledging at the same\\r\\ntime that he is better than he was in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny has had a letter full of commissions from Goodnestone; we shall be\\r\\nbusy about them and her own matters, I dare say, from twelve to four.\\r\\nNothing, I trust, will keep us from Keppel Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day has brought a most friendly letter from Mr. Fowle, with a brace\\r\\nof pheasants. I did not know before that Henry had written to him a few\\r\\ndays ago to ask for them. We shall live upon pheasants,--no bad life!\\r\\n\\r\\nI send you five one-pound notes, for fear you should be distressed for\\r\\nlittle money. Lizzy\\'s work is charmingly done; shall you put it to your\\r\\nchintz? A sheet came in this moment; 1st and 3rd vols. are now at 144;\\r\\n2nd at 48. I am sure you will like particulars. We are not to have the\\r\\ntrouble of returning the sheets to Mr. Murray any longer; the printer\\'s\\r\\nboys bring and carry.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope Mary continues to get well fast, and I send my love to little\\r\\nHerbert. You will tell me more of Martha\\'s plans, of course, when you\\r\\nwrite again. Remember me most kindly to everybody, and Miss Benn\\r\\nbesides.\\r\\n\\r\\n                            Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                   J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been listening to dreadful insanity. It is Mr. Haden\\'s firm\\r\\nbelief that a person not musical is fit for every sort of wickedness. I\\r\\nventured to assert a little on the other side, but wished the cause in\\r\\nabler hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                           HANS PLACE, Sunday (Nov. 26).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST,--The parcel arrived safely, and I am much obliged to you for\\r\\nyour trouble. It cost 2_s._ 10_d._, but as there is a certain saving of\\r\\n2_s._ 4\\xc2\\xbd_d._ on the other side, I am sure it is well worth doing. I send\\r\\nfour pair of silk stockings, but I do not want them washed at present.\\r\\nIn the three neckhandkerchiefs I include the one sent down before. These\\r\\nthings, perhaps, Edwd. may be able to bring, but even if he is not, I am\\r\\nextremely pleased with his returning to you from Steventon. It is much\\r\\nbetter, far preferable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did mention the P. R. in my note to Mr. Murray; it brought me a fine\\r\\ncompliment in return. Whether it has done any other good I do not know,\\r\\nbut Henry thought it worth trying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe printers continue to supply me very well. I am advanced in Vol. III.\\r\\nto my _arra_-root, upon which peculiar style of spelling there is a\\r\\nmodest query in the margin. I will not forget Anna\\'s arrowroot. I hope\\r\\nyou have told Martha of my first resolution of letting nobody know that\\r\\nI might dedicate, etc., for fear of being obliged to do it, and that she\\r\\nis thoroughly convinced of my being influenced now by nothing but the\\r\\nmost mercenary motives. I have paid nine shillings on her account to\\r\\nMiss Palmer; there was no more owing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, we were very busy all yesterday; from half-past eleven till four\\r\\nin the streets, working almost entirely for other people, driving from\\r\\nplace to place after a parcel for Sandling, which we could never find,\\r\\nand encountering the miseries of Grafton House to get a purple frock for\\r\\nEleanor Bridges. We got to Keppel St., however, which was all I cared\\r\\nfor; and though we could stay only a quarter of an hour, Fanny\\'s calling\\r\\ngave great pleasure, and her sensibility still greater, for she was very\\r\\nmuch affected at the sight of the children. Poor little F. looked\\r\\nheavy. We saw the whole party.\\r\\n\\r\\nAunt Harriet hopes Cassy will not forget to make a pincushion for Mrs.\\r\\nKelly, as she has spoken of its being promised her several times. I hope\\r\\nwe shall see Aunt H. and the dear little girls here on Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much for the morning. Then came the dinner and Mr. Haden, who brought\\r\\ngood manners and clever conversation. From seven to eight the harp; at\\r\\neight Mrs. L. and Miss E. arrived, and for the rest of the evening the\\r\\ndrawing-room was thus arranged: on the sofa side the two ladies, Henry,\\r\\nand myself making the best of it; on the opposite side Fanny and Mr.\\r\\nHaden, in two chairs (I believe, at least, they had two chairs), talking\\r\\ntogether uninterruptedly. Fancy the scene! And what is to be fancied\\r\\nnext? Why, that Mr. H. dines here again to-morrow. To-day we are to have\\r\\nMr. Barlow. Mr. H. is reading \"Mansfield Park\" for the first time, and\\r\\nprefers it to P. and P.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hare and four rabbits from Gm. yesterday, so that we are stocked for\\r\\nnearly a week. Poor Farmer Andrews! I am very sorry for him, and\\r\\nsincerely wish his recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nA better account of the sugar than I could have expected. I should like\\r\\nto help you break some more. I am glad you cannot wake early; I am sure\\r\\nyou must have been under great arrears of rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny and I have been to B. Chapel, and walked back with Maria Cuthbert.\\r\\nWe have been very little plagued with visitors this last week. I\\r\\nremember only Miss Herries, the aunt, but I am in terror for to-day, a\\r\\nfine bright Sunday; plenty of mortar, and nothing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry gets out in his garden every day, but at present his inclination\\r\\nfor doing more seems over, nor has he now any plan for leaving London\\r\\nbefore Dec. 18, when he thinks of going to Oxford for a few days;\\r\\nto-day, indeed, his feelings are for continuing where he is through the\\r\\nnext two months.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne knows the uncertainty of all this; but should it be so, we must\\r\\nthink the best, and hope the best, and do the best; and my idea in that\\r\\ncase is, that when he goes to Oxford I should go home, and have nearly a\\r\\nweek of you before you take my place. This is only a silent project, you\\r\\nknow, to be gladly given up if better things occur. Henry calls himself\\r\\nstronger every day, and Mr. H. keeps on approving his pulse, which seems\\r\\ngenerally better than ever, but still they will not let him be well.\\r\\nPerhaps when Fanny is gone he will be allowed to recover faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not disappointed: I never thought the little girl at Wyards very\\r\\npretty, but she will have a fine complexion and curly hair, and pass for\\r\\na beauty. We are glad the mamma\\'s cold has not been worse, and send her\\r\\nour love and good wishes by every convenient opportunity. Sweet, amiable\\r\\nFrank! why does he have a cold too? Like Captain Mirvan to Mr. Duval,[36]\\r\\n\"I wish it well over with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny has heard all that I have said to you about herself and Mr. H.\\r\\nThank you very much for the sight of dearest Charles\\'s letter to\\r\\nyourself. How pleasantly and how naturally he writes! and how perfect a\\r\\npicture of his disposition and feelings his style conveys! Poor dear\\r\\nfellow! Not a present!\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a great mind to send him all the twelve copies which were to have\\r\\nbeen dispersed among my near connections, beginning with the P. R.[2]\\r\\nand ending with Countess Morley. Adieu.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\r\\n                                                   J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive my love to Cassy and Mary Jane. Caroline will be gone when this\\r\\nreaches you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[36] Characters in Miss Burney\\'s \"Evelina.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[37] Prince Regent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        HANS PLACE, Saturday (Dec. 2).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Henry came back yesterday, and might have returned\\r\\nthe day before if he had known as much in time. I had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing from Mr. T. on Wednesday night that Mr. Seymour thought there\\r\\nwas not the least occasion for his absenting himself any longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had also the comfort of a few lines on Wednesday morning from Henry\\r\\nhimself, just after your letter was gone, giving so good an account of\\r\\nhis feelings as made me perfectly easy. He met with the utmost care and\\r\\nattention at Hanwell, spent his two days there very quietly and\\r\\npleasantly, and being certainly in no respect the worse for going, we\\r\\nmay believe that he must be better, as he is quite sure of being\\r\\nhimself. To make his return a complete gala, Mr. Haden was secured for\\r\\ndinner. I need not say that our evening was agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you seem to be under a mistake as to Mr. H. You call him an\\r\\napothecary. He is no apothecary; he has never been an apothecary; there\\r\\nis not an apothecary in this neighborhood,--the only inconvenience of\\r\\nthe situation, perhaps,--but so it is; we have not a medical man within\\r\\nreach. He is a Haden, nothing but a Haden, a sort of wonderful\\r\\nnondescript creature on two legs, something between a man and an angel,\\r\\nbut without the least spice of an apothecary. He is, perhaps, the only\\r\\nperson not an apothecary hereabouts. He has never sung to us. He will\\r\\nnot sing without a pianoforte accompaniment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Meyers gives his three lessons a week, altering his days and his\\r\\nhours, however, just as he chooses, never very punctual, and never\\r\\ngiving good measure. I have not Fanny\\'s fondness for masters, and Mr.\\r\\nMeyers does not give me any longing after them. The truth is, I think,\\r\\nthat they are all, at least music-masters, made of too much consequence,\\r\\nand allowed to take too many liberties with their scholars\\' time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall be delighted to see Edward on Monday, only sorry that you must\\r\\nbe losing him. A turkey will be equally welcome with himself. He must\\r\\nprepare for his own proper bedchamber here, as Henry moved down to the\\r\\none below last week; he found the other cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sorry my mother has been suffering, and am afraid this exquisite\\r\\nweather is too good to agree with her. I enjoy it all over me, from top\\r\\nto toe, from right to left, longitudinally, perpendicularly, diagonally;\\r\\nand I cannot but selfishly hope we are to have it last till\\r\\nChristmas,--nice, unwholesome, unseasonable, relaxing, close, muggy\\r\\nweather.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, thank you very much for your long letter; it did me a great deal of\\r\\ngood. Henry accepts your offer of making his nine gallon of mead\\r\\nthankfully. The mistake of the dogs rather vexed him for a moment, but\\r\\nhe has not thought of it since. To-day he makes a third attempt at his\\r\\nstrengthening plaister, and as I am sure he will now be getting out a\\r\\ngreat deal, it is to be wished that he may be able to keep it on. He\\r\\nsets off this morning by the Chelsea coach to sign bonds and visit\\r\\nHenrietta St., and I have no doubt will be going every day to Henrietta\\r\\nSt.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny and I were very snug by ourselves as soon as we were satisfied\\r\\nabout our invalid\\'s being safe at Hanwell. By manoeuvring and good luck\\r\\nwe foiled all the Malings\\' attempts upon us. Happily I caught a little\\r\\ncold on Wednesday, the morning we were in town, which we made very\\r\\nuseful, and we saw nobody but our precious[38] and Mr. Tilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis evening the Malings are allowed to drink tea with us. We are in\\r\\nhopes--that is, we wish--Miss Palmer and the little girls may come this\\r\\nmorning. You know, of course, that she could not come on Thursday, and\\r\\nshe will not attempt to name any other day.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod bless you. Excuse the shortness of this, but I must finish it now,\\r\\nthat I may save you 2_d._ Best love.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours affectionately,     J. A.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt strikes me that I have no business to give the P. R. a binding, but\\r\\nwe will take counsel upon the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad you have put the flounce on your chintz; I am sure it must\\r\\nlook particularly well, and it is what I had thought of.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\r\\n    Chawton, Alton, Hants.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[38] Probably a playful allusion to Mr. Haden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               CHAWTON (Feb. 20, 1816).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST FANNY,--You are inimitable, irresistible. You are the delight\\r\\nof my life. Such letters, such entertaining letters, as you have lately\\r\\nsent! such a description of your queer little heart! such a lovely\\r\\ndisplay of what imagination does! You are worth your weight in gold, or\\r\\neven in the new silver coinage. I cannot express to you what I have felt\\r\\nin reading your history of yourself,--how full of pity and concern, and\\r\\nadmiration and amusement I have been! You are the paragon of all that is\\r\\nsilly and sensible, commonplace and eccentric, sad and lively, provoking\\r\\nand interesting. Who can keep pace with the fluctuations of your fancy,\\r\\nthe capprizios of your taste, the contradictions of your feelings? You\\r\\nare so odd, and all the time so perfectly natural!--so peculiar in\\r\\nyourself, and yet so like everybody else!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very, very gratifying to me to know you so intimately. You can\\r\\nhardly think what a pleasure it is to me to have such thorough pictures\\r\\nof your heart. Oh, what a loss it will be when you are married! You are\\r\\ntoo agreeable in your single state,--too agreeable as a niece. I shall\\r\\nhate you when your delicious play of mind is all settled down into\\r\\nconjugal and maternal affections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. B---- frightens me. He will have you. I see you at the altar. I have\\r\\nsome faith in Mrs. C. Cage\\'s observation, and still more in Lizzy\\'s; and\\r\\nbesides, I know it must be so. He must be wishing to attach you. It\\r\\nwould be too stupid and too shameful in him to be otherwise; and all the\\r\\nfamily are seeking your acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not imagine that I have any real objection; I have rather taken a\\r\\nfancy to him than not, and I like the house for you. I only do not like\\r\\nyou should marry anybody. And yet I do wish you to marry very much,\\r\\nbecause I know you will never be happy till you are; but the loss of a\\r\\nFanny Knight will be never made up to me. My \"affec. niece F. C. B----\"\\r\\nwill be but a poor substitute. I do not like your being nervous, and so\\r\\napt to cry,--it is a sign you are not quite well; but I hope Mr.\\r\\nScud--as you always write his name (your Mr. Scuds amuse me very\\r\\nmuch)--will do you good.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a comfort that Cassandra should be so recovered! It was more than\\r\\nwe had expected. I can easily believe she was very patient and very\\r\\ngood. I always loved Cassandra for her fine dark eyes and sweet temper.\\r\\nI am almost entirely cured of my rheumatism,--just a little pain in my\\r\\nknee now and then, to make me remember what it was, and keep on flannel.\\r\\nAunt Cassandra nursed me so beautifully.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoy your visit to Goodnestone, it must be a great pleasure to you;\\r\\nyou have not seen Fanny Cage in comfort so long. I hope she represents\\r\\nand remonstrates and reasons with you properly. Why should you be living\\r\\nin dread of his marrying somebody else? (Yet how natural!) You did not\\r\\nchoose to have him yourself, why not allow him to take comfort where he\\r\\ncan? In your conscience you know that he could not bear a companion with\\r\\na more animated character. You cannot forget how you felt under the idea\\r\\nof its having been possible that he might have dined in Hans Place.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dearest Fanny, I cannot bear you should be unhappy about him. Think\\r\\nof his principles; think of his father\\'s objection, of want of money,\\r\\netc., etc. But I am doing no good; no, all that I urge against him will\\r\\nrather make you take his part more,--sweet, perverse Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I will tell you that we like your Henry to the utmost, to the\\r\\nvery top of the glass, quite brimful. He is a very pleasing young man. I\\r\\ndo not see how he could be mended. He does really bid fair to be\\r\\neverything his father and sister could wish; and William I love very\\r\\nmuch indeed, and so we do all; he is quite our own William. In short, we\\r\\nare very comfortable together; that is, we can answer for ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Deedes is as welcome as May to all our benevolence to her son; we\\r\\nonly lamented that we could not do more, and that the 50_l._ note we\\r\\nslipped into his hand at parting was necessarily the limit of our\\r\\noffering. Good Mrs. Deedes! Scandal and gossip; yes, I dare say you are\\r\\nwell stocked, but I am very fond of Mrs. ---- for reasons good. Thank\\r\\nyou for mentioning her praise of \"Emma,\" etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have contributed the marking to Uncle H.\\'s shirts, and now they are a\\r\\ncomplete memorial of the tender regard of many.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friday._--I had no idea when I began this yesterday of sending it\\r\\nbefore your brother went back, but I have written away my foolish\\r\\nthoughts at such a rate that I will not keep them many hours longer to\\r\\nstare me in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch obliged for the quadrilles, which I am grown to think pretty\\r\\nenough, though of course they are very inferior to the cotillons of my\\r\\nown day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen and Anna walked here last Sunday to hear Uncle Henry, and she looked\\r\\nso pretty, it was quite a pleasure to see her, so young and so blooming\\r\\nand so innocent, as if she had never had a wicked thought in her life,\\r\\nwhich yet one has some reason to suppose she must have had, if we\\r\\nbelieve the doctrine of original sin. I hope Lizzy will have her play\\r\\nvery kindly arranged for her. Henry is generally thought very\\r\\ngood-looking, but not so handsome as Edward. I think I prefer his face.\\r\\nWm. is in excellent looks, has a fine appetite, and seems perfectly\\r\\nwell. You will have a great break up at Godmersham in the spring. You\\r\\nmust feel their all going. It is very right, however! Poor Miss C.! I\\r\\nshall pity her when she begins to understand herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour objection to the quadrilles delighted me exceedingly. Pretty well,\\r\\nfor a lady irrecoverably attached to one person! Sweet Fanny, believe no\\r\\nsuch thing of yourself, spread no such malicious slander upon your\\r\\nunderstanding within the precincts of your imagination. Do not speak ill\\r\\nof your sense merely for the gratification of your fancy; yours is sense\\r\\nwhich deserves more honorable treatment. You are not in love with him;\\r\\nyou never have been really in love with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                       J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss KNIGHT,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                         CHAWTON, Thursday (March 13).\\r\\n\\r\\nAS to making any adequate return for such a letter as yours, my dearest\\r\\nFanny, it is absolutely impossible. If I were to labor at it all the\\r\\nrest of my life, and live to the age of Methuselah, I could never\\r\\naccomplish anything so long and so perfect; but I cannot let William go\\r\\nwithout a few lines of acknowledgment and reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have pretty well done with Mr. ----. By your description, he cannot be\\r\\nin love with you, however he may try at it; and I could not wish the\\r\\nmatch unless there were a great deal of love on his side. I do not know\\r\\nwhat to do about Jemima Branfill. What does her dancing away with so\\r\\nmuch spirit mean? That she does not care for him, or only wishes to\\r\\nappear not to care for him? Who can understand a young lady?\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Mrs. C. Milles, that she should die on the wrong day at last, after\\r\\nbeing about it so long! It was unlucky that the Goodnestone party could\\r\\nnot meet you; and I hope her friendly, obliging, social spirit, which\\r\\ndelighted in drawing people together, was not conscious of the division\\r\\nand disappointment she was occasioning. I am sorry and surprised that\\r\\nyou speak of her as having little to leave, and must feel for Miss\\r\\nMilles, though she is Molly, if a material loss of income is to attend\\r\\nher other loss. Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor,\\r\\nwhich is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony; but I need not\\r\\ndwell on such arguments with you, pretty dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo you I shall say, as I have often said before, Do not be in a hurry,\\r\\nthe right man will come at last; you will in the course of the next two\\r\\nor three years meet with somebody more generally unexceptionable than\\r\\nany one you have yet known, who will love you as warmly as possible, and\\r\\nwho will so completely attract you that you will feel you never really\\r\\nloved before.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo none of the A.\\'s ever come to balls now? You have never mentioned\\r\\nthem as being at any. And what do you hear of the Gripps, or of Fanny\\r\\nand her husband?\\r\\n\\r\\nAunt Cassandra walked to Wyards yesterday with Mrs. Digweed. Anna has\\r\\nhad a bad cold, and looks pale. She has just weaned Julia.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have also heard lately from your Aunt Harriot, and cannot understand\\r\\ntheir plans in parting with Miss S., whom she seems very much to value\\r\\nnow that Harriot and Eleanor are both of an age for a governess to be so\\r\\nuseful to, especially as, when Caroline was sent to school some years,\\r\\nMiss Bell was still retained, though the others even then were nursery\\r\\nchildren. They have some good reason, I dare say, though I cannot\\r\\npenetrate it; and till I know what it is I shall invent a bad one, and\\r\\namuse myself with accounting for the difference of measures by supposing\\r\\nMiss S. to be a superior sort of woman, who has never stooped to\\r\\nrecommend herself to the master of the family by flattery, as Miss Bell\\r\\ndid.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will answer your kind questions more than you expect. \"Miss Catherine\"\\r\\nis put upon the shelf for the present, and I do not know that she will\\r\\never come out; but I have a something ready for publication, which may,\\r\\nperhaps, appear about a twelvemonth hence. It is short,--about the\\r\\nlength of \"Catherine.\" This is for yourself alone. Neither Mr. Salusbury\\r\\nnor Mr. Wildman is to know of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am got tolerably well again, quite equal to walking about and enjoying\\r\\nthe air, and by sitting down and resting a good while between my walks I\\r\\nget exercise enough. I have a scheme, however, for accomplishing more,\\r\\nas the weather grows spring-like. I mean to take to riding the donkey;\\r\\nit will be more independent and less troublesome than the use of the\\r\\ncarriage, and I shall be able to go about with Aunt Cassandra in her\\r\\nwalks to Alton and Wyards.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you will think Wm. looking well; he was bilious the other day,\\r\\nand At. Cass. supplied him with a dose at his own request. I am sure you\\r\\nwould have approved it. Wm. and I are the best of friends. I love him\\r\\nvery much. Everything is so natural about him,--his affections, his\\r\\nmanners, and his drollery. He entertains and interests us extremely.\\r\\n\\r\\nMat. Hammond and A. M. Shaw are people whom I cannot care for in\\r\\nthemselves, but I enter into their situation, and am glad they are so\\r\\nhappy. If I were the Duchess of Richmond, I should be very miserable\\r\\nabout my son\\'s choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur fears increase for poor little Harriot; the latest account is that\\r\\nSir Ev. Home is confirmed in his opinion of there being water on the\\r\\nbrain. I hope Heaven, in its mercy, will take her soon. Her poor father\\r\\nwill be quite worn out by his feelings for her; he cannot spare Cassy at\\r\\npresent, she is an occupation and a comfort to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                           CHAWTON, Sunday (March 23).\\r\\n\\r\\nI AM very much obliged to you, my dearest Fanny, for sending me Mr. W.\\'s\\r\\nconversation; I had great amusement in reading it, and I hope I am not\\r\\naffronted, and do not think the worse of him for having a brain so very\\r\\ndifferent from mine; but my strongest sensation of all is astonishment\\r\\nat your being able to press him on the subject so perseveringly; and I\\r\\nagree with your papa that it was not fair. When he knows the truth, he\\r\\nwill be uncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are the oddest creature! Nervous enough in some respects, but in\\r\\nothers perfectly without nerves! Quite unrepulsable, hardened, and\\r\\nimpudent. Do not oblige him to read any more. Have mercy on him, tell\\r\\nhim the truth, and make him an apology. He and I should not in the least\\r\\nagree, of course, in our ideas of novels and heroines. Pictures of\\r\\nperfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked; but there is some very\\r\\ngood sense in what he says, and I particularly respect him for wishing\\r\\nto think well of all young ladies; it shows an amiable and a delicate\\r\\nmind. And he deserves better treatment than to be obliged to read any\\r\\nmore of my works.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not be surprised at finding Uncle Henry acquainted with my having\\r\\nanother ready for publication. I could not say No when he asked me, but\\r\\nhe knows nothing more of it. You will not like it, so you need not be\\r\\nimpatient. You may perhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good\\r\\nfor me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany thanks for your kind care for my health; I certainly have not been\\r\\nwell for many weeks, and about a week ago I was very poorly. I have had\\r\\na good deal of fever at times, and indifferent nights; but I am\\r\\nconsiderably better now, and am recovering my looks a little, which have\\r\\nbeen bad enough,--black and white, and every wrong color. I must not\\r\\ndepend upon being ever very blooming again. Sickness is a dangerous\\r\\nindulgence at my time of life. Thank you for everything you tell me. I\\r\\ndo not feel worthy of it by anything that I can say in return, but I\\r\\nassure you my pleasure in your letters is quite as great as ever, and I\\r\\nam interested and amused just as you could wish me. If there is a Miss\\r\\n_Marsden_, I perceive whom she will marry.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Evening._--I was languid and dull and very bad company when I wrote the\\r\\nabove; I am better now, to my own feelings at least, and wish I may be\\r\\nmore agreeable. We are going to have rain, and after that very pleasant\\r\\ngenial weather, which will exactly do for me, as my saddle will then be\\r\\ncompleted, and air and exercise is what I want. Indeed, I shall be very\\r\\nglad when the event at Scarlets is over, the expectation of it keeps us\\r\\nin a worry, your grandmamma especially; she sits brooding over evils\\r\\nwhich cannot be remedied, and conduct impossible to be understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the reports from Keppel St. are rather better; little Harriot\\'s\\r\\nheadaches are abated, and Sir Evd. is satisfied with the effect of the\\r\\nmercury, and does not despair of a cure. The complaint I find is not\\r\\nconsidered incurable nowadays, provided the patient be young enough not\\r\\nto have the head hardened. The water in that case may be drawn off by\\r\\nmercury. But though this is a new idea to us, perhaps it may have been\\r\\nlong familiar to you through your friend Mr. Scud. I hope his high\\r\\nrenown is sustained by driving away William\\'s cough.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell Wm. that Triggs is as beautiful and condescending as ever, and was\\r\\nso good as to dine with us to-day, and tell him that I often play at\\r\\nnines and think of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Papillons came back on Friday night, but I have not seen them yet,\\r\\nas I do not venture to church. I cannot hear, however, but that they are\\r\\nthe same Mr. P. and his sister they used to be. She has engaged a new\\r\\nmaidservant in Mrs. Calker\\'s room, whom she means to make also\\r\\nhousekeeper under herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Philmore was buried yesterday, and I, by way of saying something to\\r\\nTriggs, observed that it had been a very handsome funeral; but his\\r\\nmanner of reply made me suppose that it was not generally esteemed so. I\\r\\ncan only be sure of one part being very handsome,--Triggs himself,\\r\\nwalking behind in his green coat. Mrs. Philmore attended as chief\\r\\nmourner, in bombazine, made very short, and flounced with crape.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tuesday._--I have had various plans as to this letter, but at last I\\r\\nhave determined that Uncle Henry shall forward it from London. I want to\\r\\nsee how Canterbury looks in the direction. When once Uncle H. has left\\r\\nus, I shall wish him with you. London has become a hateful place to him,\\r\\nand he is always depressed by the idea of it. I hope he will be in time\\r\\nfor your sick. I am sure he must do that part of his duty as excellently\\r\\nas all the rest. He returned yesterday from Steventon, and was with us\\r\\nby breakfast, bringing Edward with him, only that Edwd. stayed to\\r\\nbreakfast at Wyards. We had a pleasant family day, for the Altons dined\\r\\nwith us, the last visit of the kind probably which she will be able to\\r\\npay us for many a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope your own Henry is in France, and that you have heard from him;\\r\\nthe passage once over, he will feel all happiness. I took my first ride\\r\\nyesterday, and liked it very much. I went up Mounter\\'s Lane and round by\\r\\nwhere the new cottages are to be, and found the exercise and everything\\r\\nvery pleasant; and I had the advantage of agreeable companions, as At.\\r\\nCass. and Edward walked by my side. At. Cass. is such an excellent\\r\\nnurse, so assiduous and unwearied! But you know all that already.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   Very affectionately yours,\\r\\n                                                          J. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Miss KNIGHT,\\r\\n    Godmersham Park, Canterbury.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                      CHAWTON, Sunday (Sept. 8, 1816).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I have borne the arrival of your letter to-day\\r\\nextremely well; anybody might have thought it was giving me pleasure. I\\r\\nam very glad you find so much to be satisfied with at Cheltenham. While\\r\\nthe waters agree, everything else is trifling.\\r\\n\\r\\nA letter arrived for you from Charles last Thursday. They are all safe\\r\\nand pretty well in Keppel St., the children decidedly better for\\r\\nBroadstairs; and he writes principally to ask when it will be convenient\\r\\nto us to receive Miss P., the little girls, and himself. They would be\\r\\nready to set off in ten days from the time of his writing, to pay their\\r\\nvisits in Hampshire and Berkshire, and he would prefer coming to Chawton\\r\\nfirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have answered him, and said that we hoped it might suit them to wait\\r\\ntill the last week in Septr., as we could not ask them sooner, either on\\r\\nyour account or the want of room. I mentioned the 23rd as the probable\\r\\nday of your return. When you have once left Cheltenham, I shall grudge\\r\\nevery half-day wasted on the road. If there were but a coach from\\r\\nHungerford to Chawton! I have desired him to let me hear again soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe does not include a maid in the list to be accommodated; but if they\\r\\nbring one, as I suppose they will, we shall have no bed in the house\\r\\neven then for Charles himself,--let alone Henry. But what can we do?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall have the Gt. House quite at our command; it is to be cleared of\\r\\nthe Papillons\\' servants in a day or two. They themselves have been\\r\\nhurried off into Essex to take possession,--not of a large estate left\\r\\nthem by an uncle, but to scrape together all they can, I suppose, of the\\r\\neffects of a Mrs. Rawstorn, a rich old friend and cousin suddenly\\r\\ndeceased, to whom they are joint executors. So there is a happy end of\\r\\nthe Kentish Papillons coming here.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo morning service to-day, wherefore I am writing between twelve and one\\r\\no\\'clock. Mr. Benn in the afternoon, and likewise more rain again, by the\\r\\nlook and the sound of things. You left us in doubt of Mrs. Benn\\'s\\r\\nsituation, but she has bespoke her nurse. . . . The F. A.\\'s dined with\\r\\nus yesterday, and had fine weather both for coming and going home, which\\r\\nhas hardly ever happened to them before. She is still unprovided with a\\r\\nhousemaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur day at Alton was very pleasant, venison quite right, children well\\r\\nbehaved, and Mr. and Mrs. Digweed taking kindly to our charades and\\r\\nother games. I must also observe, for his mother\\'s satisfaction, that\\r\\nEdward at my suggestion devoted himself very properly to the\\r\\nentertainment of Miss S. Gibson. Nothing was wanting except Mr. Sweeney;\\r\\nbut he, alas! had been ordered away to London the day before. We had a\\r\\nbeautiful walk home by moonlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, my back has given me scarcely any pain for many days. I have\\r\\nan idea that agitation does it as much harm as fatigue, and that I was\\r\\nill at the time of your going from the very circumstance of your going.\\r\\nI am nursing myself up now into as beautiful a state as I can, because I\\r\\nhear that Dr. White means to call on me before he leaves the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Evening._--Frank and Mary and the children visited us this morning. Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Gibson are to come on the 23rd, and there is too much reason to\\r\\nfear they will stay above a week. Little George could tell me where you\\r\\nwere gone to, as well as what you were to bring him, when I asked him\\r\\nthe other day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Tho. Miller is dead. I treat you with a dead baronet in almost every\\r\\nletter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you have C. Craven among you, as well as the Duke of Orleans and Mr.\\r\\nPocock. But it mortifies me that you have not added one to the stock of\\r\\ncommon acquaintance. Do pray meet with somebody belonging to yourself. I\\r\\nam quite weary of your knowing nobody.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Digweed parts with both Hannah and old cook: the former will not\\r\\ngive up her lover, who is a man of bad character; the latter is guilty\\r\\nonly of being unequal to anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Terry was to have spent this week with her sister, but as usual it\\r\\nis put off. My amiable friend knows the value of her company. I have not\\r\\nseen Anna since the day you left us; her father and brother visited her\\r\\nmost days. Edward and Ben called here on Thursday. Edward was in his way\\r\\nto Selborne. We found him very agreeable. He is come back from France,\\r\\nthinking of the French as one could wish,--disappointed in everything.\\r\\nHe did not go beyond Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a letter from Mrs. Perigord; she and her mother are in London\\r\\nagain. She speaks of France as a scene of general poverty and misery: no\\r\\nmoney, no trade, nothing to be got but by the innkeepers, and as to her\\r\\nown present prospects she is not much less melancholy than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have also a letter from Miss Sharp, quite one of her letters; she has\\r\\nbeen again obliged to exert herself more than ever, in a more\\r\\ndistressing, more harassed state, and has met with another excellent old\\r\\nphysician and his wife, with every virtue under heaven, who takes to her\\r\\nand cures her from pure love and benevolence. Dr. and Mrs. Storer are\\r\\ntheir Mrs. and Miss Palmer--for they are at Bridlington. I am happy to\\r\\nsay, however, that the sum of the account is better than usual. Sir\\r\\nWilliam is returned; from Bridlington they go to Chevet, and she is to\\r\\nhave a young governess under her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed Edward\\'s company very much, as I said before, and yet I was\\r\\nnot sorry when Friday came. It had been a busy week, and I wanted a few\\r\\ndays\\' quiet and exemption from the thought and contrivancy which any\\r\\nsort of company gives. I often wonder how you can find time for what you\\r\\ndo, in addition to the care of the house; and how good Mrs. West could\\r\\nhave written such books and collected so many hard words, with all her\\r\\nfamily cares, is still more a matter of astonishment. Composition seems\\r\\nto me impossible with a head full of joints of mutton and doses of\\r\\nrhubarb.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Monday._--Here is a sad morning. I fear you may not have been able to\\r\\nget to the Pump. The two last days were very pleasant. I enjoyed them\\r\\nthe more for your sake. But to-day it is really bad enough to make you\\r\\nall cross. I hope Mary will change her lodgings at the fortnight\\'s end;\\r\\nI am sure, if you looked about well, you would find others in some odd\\r\\ncorner to suit you better. Mrs. Potter charges for the name of the High\\r\\nSt.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccess to the pianoforte! I trust it will drive you away. We hear now\\r\\nthat there is to be no honey this year. Bad news for us. We must\\r\\nhusband our present stock of mead, and I am sorry to perceive that our\\r\\ntwenty gallons is very nearly out. I cannot comprehend how the fourteen\\r\\ngallons could last so long.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not much like Mr. Cooper\\'s new sermons. They are fuller of\\r\\nregeneration and conversion than ever, with the addition of his zeal in\\r\\nthe cause of the Bible Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha\\'s love to Mary and Caroline, and she is extremely glad to find\\r\\nthey like the pelisse. The Debarys are indeed odious! We are to see my\\r\\nbrother to-morrow, but for only one night. I had no idea that he would\\r\\ncare for the races without Edward. Remember me to all.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\r\\n                                                        J.

In April\\r\\nher father in a note to Mrs. Lefroy says: \"I was happy to have a good\\r\\naccount of herself written by her own hand, in a letter from your Aunt\\r\\nJane; but all who love, and that is all who know her, must be anxious on\\r\\nher account.\" We all know how well grounded that anxiety was, and how\\r\\nsoon her relations had to lament over the loss of the dearest and\\r\\nbrightest member of their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I come to the saddest letters of all, those which tell us of the\\r\\nend of that bright life, cut short just at the time when the world might\\r\\nhave hoped that unabated intellectual vigor, supplemented by the\\r\\nexperience brought by maturer years, would have produced works if\\r\\npossible even more fascinating than those with which she had already\\r\\nembellished the literature of her country. But it was not to be. The\\r\\nfiat had gone forth,--the ties which bound that sweet spirit to earth\\r\\nwere to be severed, and a blank left, never to be filled in the family\\r\\nwhich her loved and loving presence had blessed, and where she had been\\r\\nso well and fondly appreciated. In the early spring of 1817 the\\r\\nunfavorable symptoms increased, and the failure of her health was too\\r\\nvisible to be neglected. Still no apprehensions of immediate danger were\\r\\nentertained, and it is probable that when she left Chawton for\\r\\nWinchester in May, she did not recognize the fact that she was bidding a\\r\\nlast farewell to \"Home.\" Happy for her if it was so, for there are few\\r\\nthings more melancholy than to look upon any beloved place or person\\r\\nwith the knowledge that it is for \"the last time.\" In all probability\\r\\nthis grief was spared to Jane, for even after her arrival at Winchester\\r\\nshe spoke and wrote as if recovery was hopeful; and I fancy that her\\r\\nrelations were by no means aware that the end was so near.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note by Lord Brabourne._\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra\\'s letters tell the tale of the event in words that require no\\r\\naddition from me. They are simple and affecting,--the words of one who\\r\\nhad been stricken by a great grief, but whose religion stood her in\\r\\ngood stead, and enabled her to bear it with fortitude. The firm and\\r\\nloving bond of union which had ever united the Austen family, naturally\\r\\nintensified their sorrow at the loss of one of their number, and that\\r\\nthe one of whom they had been so proud as well as so fond. They laid her\\r\\nwithin the walls of the old cathedral which she had loved so much, and\\r\\nwent sorrowfully back to their homes, with the feeling that nothing\\r\\ncould replace to them the treasure they had lost. And most heavily of\\r\\nall must the blow have fallen upon the only sister, the correspondent,\\r\\nthe companion, the other self of Jane, who had to return alone to the\\r\\ndesolate home, and to the mother to whose comforts the two had hitherto\\r\\nministered together, but who would henceforward have her alone on whom\\r\\nto rely. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n      _Letters from Miss Cassandra Austen to her niece Miss\\r\\n      Knight, after the death of her sister Jane, July 18,\\r\\n      1817._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               WINCHESTER, Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST FANNY,--Doubly dear to me now for her dear sake whom we have\\r\\nlost. She did love you most sincerely, and never shall I forget the\\r\\nproofs of love you gave her during her illness in writing those kind,\\r\\namusing letters at a time when I know your feelings would have dictated\\r\\nso different a style. Take the only reward I can give you in the\\r\\nassurance that your benevolent purpose was answered; you did contribute\\r\\nto her enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven your last letter afforded pleasure. I merely cut the seal and gave\\r\\nit to her; she opened it and read it herself, afterwards she gave it to\\r\\nme to read, and then talked to me a little and not uncheerfully of its\\r\\ncontents, but there was then a languor about her which prevented her\\r\\ntaking the same interest in anything she had been used to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Tuesday evening, when her complaint returned, there was a visible\\r\\nchange, she slept more and much more comfortably; indeed, during the\\r\\nlast eight-and-forty hours she was more asleep than awake. Her looks\\r\\naltered and she fell away, but I perceived no material diminution of\\r\\nstrength, and though I was then hopeless of a recovery, I had no\\r\\nsuspicion how rapidly my loss was approaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have lost a treasure, such a sister, such a friend as never can have\\r\\nbeen surpassed. She was the sun of my life, the gilder of every\\r\\npleasure, the soother of every sorrow; I had not a thought concealed\\r\\nfrom her, and it is as if I had lost a part of myself. I loved her only\\r\\ntoo well,--not better than she deserved, but I am conscious that my\\r\\naffection for her made me sometimes unjust to and negligent of others;\\r\\nand I can acknowledge, more than as a general principle, the justice of\\r\\nthe Hand which has struck this blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know me too well to be at all afraid that I should suffer materially\\r\\nfrom my feelings; I am perfectly conscious of the extent of my\\r\\nirreparable loss, but I am not at all overpowered and very little\\r\\nindisposed,--nothing but what a short time, with rest and change of air,\\r\\nwill remove. I thank God that I was enabled to attend her to the last,\\r\\nand amongst my many causes of self-reproach I have not to add any wilful\\r\\nneglect of her comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt herself to be dying about half an hour before she became\\r\\ntranquil and apparently unconscious. During that half-hour was her\\r\\nstruggle, poor soul! She said she could not tell us what she suffered,\\r\\nthough she complained of little fixed pain. When I asked her if there\\r\\nwas anything she wanted, her answer was she wanted nothing but death,\\r\\nand some of her words were: \"God grant me patience, pray for me, oh,\\r\\npray for me!\" Her voice was affected, but as long as she spoke she was\\r\\nintelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope I do not break your heart, my dearest Fanny, by these\\r\\nparticulars; I mean to afford you gratification whilst I am relieving my\\r\\nown feelings. I could not write so to anybody else; indeed you are the\\r\\nonly person I have written to at all, excepting your grandmamma,--it\\r\\nwas to her, not your Uncle Charles, I wrote on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after dinner on Thursday I went into the town to do an\\r\\nerrand which your dear aunt was anxious about. I returned about a\\r\\nquarter before six, and found her recovering from faintness and\\r\\noppression; she got so well as to be able to give me a minute account of\\r\\nher seizure, and when the clock struck six she was talking quietly to\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot say how soon afterwards she was seized again with the same\\r\\nfaintness, which was followed by the sufferings she could not describe;\\r\\nbut Mr. Lyford had been sent for, had applied something to give her\\r\\nease, and she was in a state of quiet insensibility by seven o\\'clock at\\r\\nthe latest. From that time till half-past four, when she ceased to\\r\\nbreathe, she scarcely moved a limb, so that we have every reason to\\r\\nthink, with gratitude to the Almighty, that her sufferings were over. A\\r\\nslight motion of the head with every breath remained till almost the\\r\\nlast. I sat close to her with a pillow in my lap to assist in supporting\\r\\nher head, which was almost off the bed, for six hours; fatigue made me\\r\\nthen resign my place to Mrs. J. A. for two hours and a half, when I took\\r\\nit again, and in about an hour more she breathed her last.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was able to close her eyes myself, and it was a great gratification to\\r\\nme to render her those last services. There was nothing convulsed which\\r\\ngave the idea of pain in her look; on the contrary, but for the\\r\\ncontinual motion of the head she gave one the idea of a beautiful\\r\\nstatue, and even now, in her coffin, there is such a sweet, serene air\\r\\nover her countenance as is quite pleasant to contemplate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day, my dearest Fanny, you have had the melancholy intelligence,\\r\\nand I know you suffer severely, but I likewise know that you will apply\\r\\nto the fountain-head for consolation, and that our merciful God is never\\r\\ndeaf to such prayers as you will offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last sad ceremony is to take place on Thursday morning; her dear\\r\\nremains are to be deposited in the cathedral. It is a satisfaction to me\\r\\nto think that they are to lie in a building she admired so much; her\\r\\nprecious soul, I presume to hope, reposes in a far superior mansion. May\\r\\nmine one day be reunited to it!\\r\\n\\r\\nYour dear papa, your Uncle Henry, and Frank and Edwd. Austen, instead of\\r\\nhis father, will attend. I hope they will none of them suffer lastingly\\r\\nfrom their pious exertions. The ceremony must be over before ten\\r\\no\\'clock, as the cathedral service begins at that hour, so that we shall\\r\\nbe at home early in the day, for there will be nothing to keep us here\\r\\nafterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Uncle James came to us yesterday, and is gone home to-day. Uncle\\r\\nH. goes to Chawton to-morrow morning; he has given every necessary\\r\\ndirection here, and I think his company there will do good. He returns\\r\\nto us again on Tuesday evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not think to have written a long letter when I began, but I have\\r\\nfound the employment draw me on, and I hope I shall have been giving you\\r\\nmore pleasure than pain. Remember me kindly to Mrs. J. Bridges (I am so\\r\\nglad she is with you now), and give my best love to Lizzie and all the\\r\\nothers.\\r\\n\\r\\n           I am, my dearest Fanny,\\r\\n                         Most affectionately yours,\\r\\n                                                CASS. ELIZ. AUSTEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said nothing about those at Chawton, because I am sure you hear\\r\\nfrom your papa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                    CHAWTON, Tuesday (July 29, 1817).\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAREST FANNY,--I have just read your letter for the third time, and\\r\\nthank you most sincerely for every kind expression to myself, and still\\r\\nmore warmly for your praises of her who I believe was better known to\\r\\nyou than to any human being besides myself. Nothing of the sort could\\r\\nhave been more gratifying to me than the manner in which you write of\\r\\nher; and if the dear angel is conscious of what passes here, and is not\\r\\nabove all earthly feelings, she may perhaps receive pleasure in being so\\r\\nmourned. Had she been the survivor, I can fancy her speaking of you in\\r\\nalmost the same terms. There are certainly many points of strong\\r\\nresemblance in your characters; in your intimate acquaintance with each\\r\\nother, and your mutual strong affection, you were counterparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday was not so dreadful a day to me as you imagined. There was so\\r\\nmuch necessary to be done that there was no time for additional misery.\\r\\nEverything was conducted with the greatest tranquillity, and but that I\\r\\nwas determined I would see the last, and therefore was upon the listen,\\r\\nI should not have known when they left the house. I watched the little\\r\\nmournful procession the length of the street; and when it turned from my\\r\\nsight, and I had lost her forever, even then I was not overpowered, nor\\r\\nso much agitated as I am now in writing of it. Never was human being\\r\\nmore sincerely mourned by those who attended her remains than was this\\r\\ndear creature. May the sorrow with which she is parted with on earth be\\r\\na prognostic of the joy with which she is hailed in heaven!\\r\\n\\r\\nI continue very tolerably well,--much better than any one could have\\r\\nsupposed possible, because I certainly have had considerable fatigue of\\r\\nbody as well as anguish of mind for months back; but I really am well,\\r\\nand I hope I am properly grateful to the Almighty for having been so\\r\\nsupported. Your grandmamma, too, is much better than when I came home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not think your dear papa appeared unwell, and I understand that he\\r\\nseemed much more comfortable after his return from Winchester than he\\r\\nhad done before. I need not tell you that he was a great comfort to me;\\r\\nindeed, I can never say enough of the kindness I have received from him\\r\\nand from every other friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get out of doors a good deal, and am able to employ myself. Of course\\r\\nthose employments suit me best which leave me most at leisure to think\\r\\nof her I have lost, and I do think of her in every variety of\\r\\ncircumstance,--in our happy hours of confidential intercourse, in the\\r\\ncheerful family party which she so ornamented, in her sick-room, on her\\r\\ndeath-bed, and as (I hope) an inhabitant of heaven. Oh, if I may one day\\r\\nbe reunited to her there! I know the time must come when my mind will be\\r\\nless engrossed by her idea, but I do not like to think of it. If I think\\r\\nof her less as on earth, God grant that I may never cease to reflect on\\r\\nher as inhabiting heaven, and never cease my humble endeavors (when it\\r\\nshall please God) to join her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn looking at a few of the precious papers which are now my property I\\r\\nhave found some memorandums, amongst which she desires that one of her\\r\\ngold chains may be given to her god-daughter Louisa, and a lock of her\\r\\nhair be set for you. You can need no assurance, my dearest Fanny, that\\r\\nevery request of your beloved aunt will be sacred with me. Be so good as\\r\\nto say whether you prefer a brooch or ring. God bless you, my dearest\\r\\nFanny.\\r\\n\\r\\n             Believe me, most affectionately yours,\\r\\n                                             CASS. ELIZTH.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\\r\\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\\r\\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\\r\\nFoundation\\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
